agriculture and bussfflng, the weaving and stitching

and iron ; hence we realize that it was by applying
the hand of the artificer to the discoveries of thought
and observations of the senses that all our conveniences
were attained, and we were enabled to have shelter,

includes flesh‚ fish and fowl, obtained partly by the
