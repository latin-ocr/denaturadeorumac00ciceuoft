“Nor indeed can Ι fully decide what their plan is
or what they mean. For sometimes when we address
them in this sort of language‚ ‘If your contentions
are true, then everything will be uncertain,' they
reply‚ ‘ Well, what has that to do with us ? surely it
is not our fault; blame nature for having hidden
truth quite away, in an abyss, as Democritus says.' δ
But others make a more elaborate answer, and
actually complain because we charge them with say-
ing that everything is uncertain, and they try to
explain the difference between what is uncertain and
what cannot be grasped, and to distinguish between
them. Let us therefore deal with those who make
this distinction, and leave on one side as a hopeless
sort of persons the others who say that all things are
as uncertain as whether the number of the stars is
odd or even. For they hold (and this in fact, I
noticed,⁶ excites your school extremely) that some-
thing is ⁸ probable,’ or as it were‘i resembling the
truth, and that this provides them with a canon of
