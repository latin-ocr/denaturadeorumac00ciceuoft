DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙΙ. νίίί.

have produced my reasons, but so far from your re-
futing them, every time when you seem to be on the
point of subjecting me to an examination and Ι get
ready to reply, you suddenly switch off the discussion,
and do not give me an opportunity of answering.
And so matters of the first importance have passed
without remark—such as divination, and fate, sub-
Jects which you dismiss very briefly, whereas our
school is accustomed to say a great deal about them,
though they are quite distinct from the topic with
which we are now dealing. Please therefore adopt an
orderly mode of procedure, and in this debate let us
clear up this question that is now before us.”

“By all means,'’ said Cotta3 “ and accordingly,
as you divided the whole subject into four parts, and
we have spoken about the first part, let us consider
the second. It seems to me to have amounted to
this z you intended to show what the gods are like,

minds exactly as we see externa] objects with our
eyes ἱ But when you say that nothing is superior to
the world, what do you mean by superior? If you
mean more beautiful, I agree 3 if more suited to our
convenience, I agree to that too3 but if what you
mean is that nothing is wiser than the world, I
