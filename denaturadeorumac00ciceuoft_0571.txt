itself no inconsiderable mark of insanity. But the
way in which they harp on cases of resemblance
between twins or between the seals stamped by
signet-rings is childish. For which of us denies that
resemblances exist, since they are manifest in ever
so many things ? but if the fact that many things are
like many other things is enough to do away with
knowledge, why are you not content with that,
especially as we admit it, and why do you prefer to
urge a contention utterly excluded by the nature of
things, denying that everything is what it is in a
class of its own and that two or more objects never
possess a common character differing in nothing at
alla? For example, granting that eggs are extremely
like eggs and bees like bees, why therefore do you
do battle? Or what are you at in this matter of
twins? for it is granted that two twins are alike,
and that might have satisfied you; but you want
them to be not alike but downright identical‚ which

Democritus says that there are a countless number of
worlds, and what is more that some of them to such
an extent not merely resemble but completely and
absolutely match each other in every detail that there
is positively no difference between them, and that
the same is true of human beings. Then you demand
that if one world so completely matches another
world that there is not even the smallest difference
between them, it shall be granted to you that in this
world of ours likewise some one thing so completely
matches some other thing that there is no difference
