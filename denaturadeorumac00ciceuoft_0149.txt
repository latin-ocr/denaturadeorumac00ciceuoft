DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xliv.

thing attractive in the very sound of the word ‘ love,'
from which the Latin term for friendship is derived.
If we base our friendship on its profit to ourselves,
and not on its advantage to those whom we love,
it will not be friendship at all, but a mere bartering
of selfish interests. That is our standard of value for
meadows and fields and herds of cattle: we esteem
them for the profits that we derive from them 3
but affection and friendship between men is disin-
terested3 how much more so therefore is that of the
gods, who, although 1n need of nothing, yet both love
each other and care for the interests of men. If this
be not so, why do we worship and pray to them?
why have pontiffs and au gurs to preside over our sacri-
fices and auspices? why make petitions and vow
offerings to heav‘en? Vx hy, but Epicurus (you tell
23 me) actually wrote a treatise on holiness.' Epicurus Epicurus

is making fun of us, though he is not so much a ἓξζῑῗθξο
humorist as a loose and careless writer. For how can avosd
holiness exist if the gods pay no heed to man's ggffiffir
affairs? Yet what is the meaning of an animate
being that pays no heed to anything. ³

‘It 15 doubtless therefore truer to say, as the good
friend of us all, Posidonius, argued in the fifth book
of his On the Nature of the Gods, that Epicurus does
not really believe 111 the gods at all, and that he said
what he djd about the immortal gods only for the
sake of deprecating popular odium. Indeed he could
not have been so senseless as really to imagine god to
be like a feeble human being, but resembling him
only in outline and surface, not in solid substance,
and possessing all man’s limbs but entirely incapable
of using them, an emaciated and transparent being,

showing no kindness or beneficence to anybody,
