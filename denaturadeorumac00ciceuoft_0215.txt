DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxiv.—xxv.

in human form have furnished the poets with legends or personi-
and have filled man's life with superstitious of all gffigffi‘ss?
sortS. This subject was handled by Zeno and was (ῐξιίῡ,
later explained more fully by Cleanthes and Chrys- ᾗῗὲἐῖᾞῗιὴο
ippus. For example, an ancient belief prevailed ῗξᾶἓῖξέξ)
throughout Greece that Caelus ‘² was mutilated by his

‘ the helping father,' whom with a change of inflexion
we style Jove, from iuvare ‘ to help ’ ; the poets call
him ‘ father of gods and men,' and our ancestors en-
titled him ‘ best and greatest,’ putting the title ‘ best‚’
that is most beneficent, before that of ‘ greatest,'
because universal beneficence is greater, or at least
more lovable, than the possession of great wealth—
