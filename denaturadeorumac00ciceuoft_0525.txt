matter for investigation and that human beings
deserve to have their views discussed. But Philo,
in raising certain revolutionary doctrines because he
was scarcely able to withstand the usual arguments
against the obstinacy of the Academics, manifestly
propounds what is not true, as he was blamed for
doing by the elder Catulus, and also, as Antiochus
proved, himself slipped into the very position that
he was afraid of. For when he thus maintained
that there was nothing that could be grasped (that
is the expression that we choose in rendering
acatalepton α), if that ‘ presentation ’ of which he
spoke (for we have by this time sufficiently habituated
ourselves by our yesterday's conversation to this
rendering of phantasia) was, as Zeno defined it, a
presentation impressed and moulded from the object
from which it came in a form such as it could not
have if it came from an object that was not the one
that it actually did come from (we declare that this
definition of Zeno's is absolutely correct, for how
can anything be grasped in such a way as to make
you absolutely confident that it has been perceived
and known, if it has a form that could belong to it
even if it were false ?)—when Philo weakens and
abolishes this, he abolishes the criterion between the
unknowable and the knowable3 which leads to the
inference that nothing can be grasped—-so in-
cautiously does he come round to the position that
he most wants to avoid. Therefore the whole de-
fence of the ease against the Academy is undertaken
by us on the line of preserving the process of defini-
