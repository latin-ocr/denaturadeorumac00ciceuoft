DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xix.

tion briefer than the subject demands. Epicurus
then, as he not merely discerns abstruse and recondite
things with his mind’s eye, but handles them as
tangible realities, teaches that the substance and
nature of the gods is such that, in the first place, it
is perceived not by the senses but by the mind, and
not materially or individuall y, like the solid objects
which Epicurus in virtue of their substantiality en-
titles steremnia 3 but by our perceiving images owing
to their similarity and succession, because an endless
train of precisely similar images arises from the
innumerable atoms and streams towards the gods,⁰
our mind with the keenest feelings of pleasure fixes
its gaze on these imageS, and so attains an under-
standing of the nature of a being both blessed and

50 eternal. Moreover there is the supremely potent Divino
principle of infinity, which claims the closest and most ἓᾞᾶζᾱῆῗξῗῖ

the following property, that in the sum of things liffiffim·
everything has its exact match and counterpart.
This property is termed by Epicurus isonomia, or the
principle of uniform distribution. From this prin-
ciple it follows that if the whole number of mortals
be so many, there must exist no less a number of
immortals, and if the causes of destruction are beyond
count, the causes of conservation also are bound to
be infinite.
