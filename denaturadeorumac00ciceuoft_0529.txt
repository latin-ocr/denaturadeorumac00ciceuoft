Antiope ' or ⁴ Andromaches ‘² when we have not
even a suspicion of it! It is unnecessary to talk
at all about the faculties of taste and smell, which
possess a certain discernment‚ although it is of 3
defective sort. Why speak of touch, and indeed of
the internal tactual sense, as the philosophers call it,
perceptive of either pain or pleasure, the sole basis,
as the Cyrenaics think, of our judgement of truth‚
caused by the mere process of sensation ? Is it
therefore possible for anybody to say that there is no
difference between a person experiencing pain and
a person experiencing pleasure, or would not the
21 holder of this opinion be a manifest lunatic? But
then whatever character belongs to these objects
which we say are perceived by the senses must belong
to that following set of objects which are said to
be perceived not by actual sensation but by a sort
of sensation, as for example z ‘ Yonder thing is
white, this thing is sweet, that one is melodious, this
fragrant, this rough.’ This class of percepts consists
of comprehensions grasped by our mind, not by our
senses. Then ‘ Yonder object is a horse, yonder 3
dog.’ Next follows the rest of the series linking on
3 chain of larger percepts, for instance the following,
which embrace as it were a fully completed grasp of
the objects z ‘ If it is a human being, it is a rational
mortal animal.’ From this class of percept are im-
printed upon us our notions of things, without which
all understandjng and all investigation and dis-
22 cussion are impossible. But if false notions existed
(I understood you to employ ὃ ‘ notions ' to render
ennoiai)—well, if there were these false notions or
notions imprinted on the mind by appearances of 3
kind that could not be distinguished from false ones,
