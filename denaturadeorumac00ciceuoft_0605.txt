ACADEMICA, II. (Limnatis), xxv.—xxvi.

But, you say, we don't wish for more ἔ What, do you
think a mole doesn’t wish for light ? And I should
not quarrel with the deity so much about the limited
range of my sight as about its inaccuracy. Do you
see yonder ship ? To us she appears to be at anchor‚
whereas to those on board her this house appears in
motion. Seek for a reason for this appearance, and
however much you succeed in finding one—though I
doubt if you can—you will not have made out that
you have got a true witness but that your witness is

Why do Ι talk about a ship. Ῥ for I saw a that you think
the illustration of the oar contemptible; perhaps you
want bigger examples. What can be bigger than
the sun, which the mathematicians declare to be
nineteen times the size of the earth ὓ ? How tiny it
looks to us ! to me it seems about a foot in diameter.
Epicurus on the other hand thinks that it may possibly
be even smaller than it looks, though not much ; he
thinks that it is not much larger either, or else
exactly the size that it appears to be, so that the
eyes either do not lie at all or else not much. What
becomes then of that ‘once '⁰ of which we spoke?
But let us quit this gullible person, who thinks that
the senses never lie,—not even now, when the sun up
there, that is travelling with such rapidity that the
magnitude of its velocity cannot even be conceived,
33 nevertheless appears to us to be standing still. But
to narrow down the controversy, pray see how small
a point it is on which the issue turns. There are four
heads of argument intended to prove that there is
nothing that can be known, perceived or compre-
hended, which is the subject of all this debate : the
first of these arguments is that there is such a thing
