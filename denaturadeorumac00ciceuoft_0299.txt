DE NATURA DEORUM, II. lix—lx.

create the arts that serve either practical necessities man’s gift os
or the purpose of amusement. Then take the gift of {ge‘gssgaffi‘}
speech, the queen of arts as you are fond of calling
it—what a glorious, what a divine faculty it is l In

the first place it enables us both to learn things we do

not know and to teach things we do know to others ;
secondly it is our instrument for exhortation and per-

which is the channel by which the voice, originating
from the mind, is caught and uttered. Next, the
tongue is placed in the mouth and confined by the
teeth ; it modulates and defines the inarticulate flow
of the voice and renders its sounds distinct and clear
by striking the teeth and other parts of the mouth.
Accordingly my school is fond of comparing the tongue
to the quill of a lyre, the teeth to the strings‚ and the
nostrils to the horns which echo‘2 the notes of the
strings when the instrument is played.

the manipulation of the fingers the hand is enabled
to paint, to model, to carve, and to draw forth the

notes of the lyre and of the flute. And beside these
