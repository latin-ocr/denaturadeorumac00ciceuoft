DE NATURA DEORUM, I. xxxix.—xl.

I do not understand the doctrine, if you who maintain
it understood it yourselves l How can you prove that
the stream of images is continuous, or if it is, how are
the images eternal? You say that there is an in-
numerable supply of atoms. Are you going to argue
then that everything is eternal, for the same reason ?
You take refuge in the principle of ‘ equilibrium ’
(for so with your consent we will translate isonomia),
and you say that because there is mortal substance
there must also be immortal substance. On that
showing, because there are mortal men, there are
also some that are immortal, and because there are
men born on land, there are men born in the
water. ‘ And because there are forces of destruc·
tion, there are also forces of preservation.' Suppose
there were, they would only preserve things that
already exist ; but I am not aware that your gods do
110 exist. But be that as it may, how do all your
pictures of obj ectsa arise out of the atoms? even if the
atoms existed, which they do not, they might con-
ceivably be capable of pushing and jostling one
another about by their collisions, but they could not
create form, shape, colour, life. You fail entirely
therefore to prove divine immortality.
