DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. ix.—-x.

extremely miserable, precisely because they are fools
(for what can be mentioned more miserable than
folly ?), and in the second place because there are so
many troubles in life that, though wise men can
assuage them by balancing against them life's
advantages, fools can neither avoid their approach
nor endure their presence. X. Those on the
