DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xl.

‘⁶ Oh, no doubt,’' interposed Velleius 3 “ why, he
thinks that even our dreams are sent to us by Jupiter
—though dreams themselves are not so unsubstantial
as a Stoic disquisition on the nature of the godS.’'

Here the conversation ended, and we parted‚
Velleius thinking Cotta's discourse to be the truer,
while Ι felt that that of Balbus approximated more
nearly to a semblance of the truth.
