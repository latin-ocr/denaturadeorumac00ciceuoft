INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

tally opposed ; for Epicurus taught that peace of mind
is won by liberating the will from nature's law, the
Stoics that it comes by submitting to it. Moreover,
though both were materialistic, in their detailed
systems of nature they differed widely.

EmeunsAN TnssomGY.—With both schools alike,
Theology fell under the second department of philo-
sophy, Physics. But with Epicurus it was only an
appendix to his main theory of nature. This he based
upon the atomism of Democritus, holding that the
real universe consists in innumerable atoms of matter
moving by the force of gravity through an infinity of
empty space. Our world and all its contents, and
also innumerable other worlds, are temporary clusters
of atoms fortuitously collected together in the void ;
they are constantly forming and constantly dissolving,
without plan or purpose. There are gods, because
all men believe in them and some men have seen them,
and all sensations are true, and so are all beliefs if
uncontradjcted by sensations. The gods (like every-
thing else) consist of fortuitous clusters of atoms, and
our perceptions of them (as of everything else) are
caused by atomic films floating off from the surface of
their forms and impinging on the atoms of our minds.
But it is impious to fancy that the gods are burdened
with the labour of upholding or guiding the universe 3
the worlds go on of themselves, by purely mechanical
causation ; the gods live a life of undisturbed bliss in
the intermundia, the empty regions of space between
the worlds.

S'r01c THEOLoov.-—The Stoics‚ on the contrary, held
that the universe is controlled by God, and in the last
resort is God. The sole ultimate reality is the divine
Mind, which expresses itself in the world-process.
