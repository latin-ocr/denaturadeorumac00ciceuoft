violence from without 3 it therefore follows that
every living thing is liable to death and dissolution,

of change, nothing made of wax would be incapable
of change, and likewise nothing made of silver or
bronze if silver and bronze were substances capable (iii->com-
of change, therefore similarly, if all the elements of ἕζῗῇἶῐῗᾷ

-there can be no body not liable to change ; but the uestraen-
elements of which, according to your school, all things 1b10,
are composed are liable to change ; therefore every
body is liable to change. But if any body were not
liable to death, then not every body would be liable
to change. Hence it follows that every body is liable
to death. In fact every body consists of either water
or air or fire or earth, or of a combination of these ele-
ments or some of them 3 but none of these elements

31 is exempt from destruction3 for everything of an
earthy nature is divisible, and also liquid substance
is soft and therefore easily crushed and broken up,
while fire and air are very readily impelled by impacts
of all kinds, and are of a consistency that is extremely
yielding and easily dissipated ; and besides, all these
elements perish when they undergo transmutation,
which occurs when earth turns into water, and when
from water arises air, and from air aether, and when
alternately the same processes are reversed3 but if
those elements of which every living thing consists

32 can perish, no living thing is everlasting. XIII. And, [niv->ysm-
to drop this line of argument, nevertheless no living ffigssssfflg ΟΥ
thing can be found which either was never born or md 9³¹⁰
will live for ever. For every living thing has sensa-
tion3 therefore it perceives both heat and cold, both

sweetness and sourness—-it cannot through any of the
