DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xix.—xx.

sanctified with divine honours for the purpose of
promoting valour, to make the best men more willing-
to encounter danger for their country’s sake. This
is the reason why Erechtheus and his daughters have
been deified at Athens, and likewise there is the
Leonatic⁰ shrine at Athens, which is named Leb-
corion. The people of Alabanda indeed worship
Alabandus, the founder of that city, more devoutly
than any of the famous deities. And it was there that
Stratonicus uttered one of his many witty sayings ;
some person obnoxious to him swore that Alabandus
was divine and Hercules was not ι ‘ Well and good,'
said Stratonicus, ‘ let the wrath of Alabandus fall on

the sun and moon are deities, and the Greeks identify
the former with Apollo and the latter with Diana.
But if the Moon is a goddess, then Lucifer also
and the rest of the planets will have to be counted
gods3 and if so, then the fixed stars as well. But
why should not the glorious Rainbow be included
among the gods ? it is beautiful enough, and its mar-
vellous loveliness has given rise to the legend that
Iris is the daughter of Thaumas.²' And if the rainbow
is a divinity, what will you do about the clouds ? The
rainbow itself is caused by some coloration of the
clouds ; and also a cloud is fabled to have given birth
to the Centaurs. But if you enroll the clouds among
the gods, you will undoubtedly have to enroll the
seasons, which have been deified in the national
ritual of Rome. If so, then rain and tempest, storm
and whirlwind must be deemed divine. At any rate
