world, must be regarded as limbs of god, undergoing
the extremes of heat and cold respectively.

25 “ So much, Lucilius, for the doctrines of your Theology ot
school. To show what <the older systems> are like, {³5:1¹}ssssss
I will trace their history from the remotest of your from
predecessors. Thales of Miletus, who was the first gmwffffvard
person to investigate these matters, said that water refuted.
was the first principle of things, but that god was
the mind that moulded all things out of water-
supposing that gods can exist without sensation ;
and why did he make mind an adjunct of water, if
mind can exist by itself, devoid of body ? The view
of Anaximander is that the gods are not everlasting
but are born and perish at long intervals of time,
and that they are worlds, countless in number. But
how can we conceive of god save as living for ever ?

26 Ν ext, Anaximenes held that air is god, and that it has
a beginning in time, and is immeasurable and infinite
in extent, and is always in motion ; just as if formless
air could be god, especially seeing that it is proper to
god to possess not merely some shape but the most
beautiful shape; or as if anything that has had a
beginning must not necessarily be mortal. XI. Then
there is Anaxagoras, the successor of Anaximenes3
he was the first thinker to hold that the orderly dis-
position of the universe is designed and perfected by
the rational power of an infinite mind. But in saying
this he failed to see that there can be no such thing
as sentient and continuous activity in that which is
infinite, and that sensation in general can only occur
when the subject itself becomes sentient by the
impact of a sensation. Further, if he intended his
infinite mind to be a definite living creature, it must

have some inner principle of life to justify the name.
