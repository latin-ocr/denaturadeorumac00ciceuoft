DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xliv.

Next in the mighty zone comes Capricorn,
Half-brute, half-man ς his mig-hty bosom breathes
An icy chill 3 and when the Titan sun

Arrayeth him with never-ceasing light,

He turns his car to climb the wintry sky.

113 Here we behold

How there appears the Scorpion rising high,
His mighty tail trailing the bended Bow ;
Near which on soaring pinions wheels the Bird
And near to this the burning Eagle flies,

Then the Dolphin,

And then Orion slopes his stooping frame.
114 Following him

The glowing Dog-s’car radiantly shines.
After this follows the Hare,

Who never resteth weary from her race ;

At the Dog’s tail meandering Argo glides.

Her the Ram covers, and the scaly F ishes,

And her bright breast touches the River’s ⁶ banks.

Its long winding current you will observe,

And in the zenith you will see the Chains
That bind the F ishes, hanging at their tails, . . .

Then you’ll descry, near the bright Scorpion's sting,
The Altar, fanned by Auster’s gentle breath.

And by it 'che Centaur

Proceeds, in haste to join the Horse’s parts
Unto the Claws3 extending his right hand,
That grasps the mighty beast, he marches on
And grimly strides towards the Altar bright.
Here Hydra rises from the nether realms,

her body widely outstretched 3

And in her midmost coil the Wine-bowl gleams,
While pressing at her tail the feathered Crow

Pecks with his beak ; and here, hard by the Twins‚
The Hound's Forerunner, in Greek named Prokyon.

⁸ Called Eridanus, and identified with the Po or the Nile.
