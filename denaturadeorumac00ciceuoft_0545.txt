ACADEMICA, II. (LUCULLcs), xi.

false that is common to both α cannot have any criterion
or any mark of truth at all. ,Ρ or when they say
that they only remove the possibility of anything ὸ
presenting an appearance of such a sort that a false
thing could not present the same appearance, but
that they allow everything else, they act childishly.
Having abolished the means by which all things are
judged, they say they do not abolish the remaining
sources of knowledge 3 just as if anybody were to say
that when he has deprived a man of his eyes he has not
taken away from that man the possible obj ects of sight.
For just as the obj ects of sight are recognized only by
means of the eyes, so everything else is recognized by
means of sense-presentations ; but they are recognized
by a mark that belongs specially to what is true, and
is not common to the true and the false. Therefore if
you bring forward‘ probable presentation,’ or ‘ probable
and unhampered presentation,’ ⁰ as Carneades held, or
something else, as a guide for you to follow, you will
have to come back to the sense-presentation that we
34 are dealing with. But if this has community with a
false presentation, it will contain no standard ofj udge-
ment, because a special property cannot be indicated
by a common mark ; while if on the contrary there is
nothing in common between them, I have got what I
want, for I am looking for a thing that may appear
to me so true that it could not appear to me in the
same way if it were false. They are involved in the
same mistake when under stress of truth's upbraiding
they desire to distinguish between things perceived
and things perspicuous, and try to prove that there is
such a thing as something perspicuous which although

received at the same time (which might turn one’s attention
away from it, περισπᾶν) is found to be consistent with them.
