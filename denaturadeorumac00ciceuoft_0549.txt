as they are in the habit of saying, towards the actual
truth, or indeed come as near to it as possible. For to
enable them to trust their judgement, it will be neces-

sary for the characteristic mark of truth to be known

to them, and if this be obscured and suppressed, what

truth pray will they suppose that they attain to ?
What language moreover could be more absurd than

proof of yonder object, and therefore I follow it, but

it is possible that the object that it indicates may be
either false ‘² or entirely non-existent ' ? But enough

residing in the senses, it was at the same time dis-
closed that many things are grasped and perceived
by the senses, which cannot happen without the act
of assent. Again, as the greatest difference between
an inanimate and an animate object is that an ani-
mate object performs some action (for an entirely
inactive animal is an utterly inconceivable thing),
either it must be denied the possession of sensation
or it must be assigned a faculty of assenting as a
38 voluntary act. But on the other hand persons who
refuse to exercise either sensation or assent are in a
manner robbed of the mind itself 3 for as the scale of
a balance must necessarily sink when weights are

put in it, so the mind must necessarily yield to clear
