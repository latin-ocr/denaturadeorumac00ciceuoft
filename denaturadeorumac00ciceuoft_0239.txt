DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxxiv.

of the world are governed by nature, the world
itself must needs be governed by nature. Now the
government of the world contains nothing that could
possibly be censured3 given the existing elements,
the best that could be produced from them has been

“ But if the structure of the world in all its parts is

such that it could not have been better whether in
point of utility or beauty, let us consider whether
this is the result of chance, or whether on the contrary
the parts of the world are in such a condition that
they could not possibly have cohered together if they
were not controlled by intelligence and by divine
providence. If then the products of nature are better
than those of art, and if art produces nothing without
reason, nature too cannot be deemed to be without
reason. When you see a statue or a painting, you
recognize the exercise of art3 when you observe
from a distance the course of a ship, you do not hesi-
tate to assume that its motion is guided by reason and
by art ; when you look at a sun-dial or a water-clock,
you infer that it tells the time by art and not by
chance3 how then can it be consistent to suppose
that the world, which includes both the works of art
in question, the craftsmen who made them, and
everything else besides, can be devoid of purpose and

88 of reason ? Suppose a traveller to carry into Scythia
or Britain the orrery recently constructed by our
friend Posidonius, which at each revolution repro-

duces the same motions of the sun, the moon and the
