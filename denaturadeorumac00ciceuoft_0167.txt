DE NATURA DEORUM, II. v.

13 V. As to their nature there are various opinions,
but their existence nobody denies. Indeed our ( ) Con-
master Cleanthes gav e four reasons to account for the1⁵³enajl¹ss¹f21f
formation in rnen 's minds of their ideas of the g0d5,e¹}1p1mnedby
Hc put first the argument of which I spoke just now, ⁰¹²³ &¹¹⁶⁸
the one arising from our foreknowledge of future
events, · second, the one drawn from the magnitude
of the benefits which we deiive from our temperate
climate, from the earth' s fertility‚ and from a vast

14 abundance of other blessings3 third, the awe in-
spired by lightning, 51011115,ἰ3 lain, snow, hail, floods,
pestilenees, earthquakes and occasionally subter-
ranean rumblings, showers of stones and raindrops the
colour of blood, also landslips and chasms suddenly
opening in the ground, also unnatural monstrosities
human and animal, and also the appearance of
meteorie lights and what. are called by the Greeks

‘eometsf and in our language‘ long· -haired stars,'

such as recently during the Octavian Wara appeared
as harbingers of dire disasters,²' and the doubling of
the sun, which my father told me had happened 1n
the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius, the 3 ear⁰ in
which the light was quenched of Publius Africanus,
that second& sun of Rome: all of which alarming
portents have suggested to mankind the idea of

15 the existence of some celestia] and divine pou er And
the fourth and most potent cause of the belief he said
was the uniform motion and revolution of the heav ens,
and the varied groupings and ordered beauty of the
sun, moon and stars, the very sight of 11111011 was in
itself enough to prove that these things are not the
mere effect of chance W hen a man goes into a house,

was not discovered; cf. iii. 80.
