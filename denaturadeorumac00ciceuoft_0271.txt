DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xlvii—xlviii.

with spines; some we see covered with feathers,
some with scales, some armed with horns, some
equipped with wings to escape their foes. Nature,
however, has provided with bounteous plenty for
each species of animal that food which is suited to it.
I might show in detail what provision has been made
in the forms of the animals for appropriating and
assimilating this food, how skilful and exact is the
disposition of the various parts, how marvellous the ’
structure of the limbs. For all the organs, at least

some by crawling, some by flying, some by swimming ;
and some seize their nutriment with their gaping
mouth and with the teeth themselves, others snatch
it in the grasp of their claws, others with their curved
beaks, some suck, others graze, some swallow it
whole, others chew it. Also some are of such lowly
stature that they easily reach their food upon the
23 ground with their jaws 3 whereas the taller species,
such as geese, swans, cranes and camels, are aided
by the length of their necks ; the elephant is
even provided with a hand, because his body is so
large that it was difficult for him to reach his food.

mode of sustenance was to seed on animals of
another species received from nature the gift either
of strength or swiftness. Upon certain creatures
