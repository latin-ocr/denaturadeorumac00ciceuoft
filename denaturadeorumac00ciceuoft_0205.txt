always doing the same things at the same times.
Below this and nearer to the earth moves the star
of Jupiter, called Phaethon (the blazing star), which
completes the same circuit of the twelve signs of the
zodiac in twelve years, and makes the same varia-

orbit next below is that of Pyroeis (the fiery), which
is called the star of Mars, and this covers the same
orbit as the two planets above it in twenty-four
months all but (I think) six days. Below this in turn
is the star os Mercury, called by the Greeks Stilbon
(the gleaming), which completes the circuit of the
zodiac in about the period of 3 year, and is never
distant from the sun more than the space of 3 single
sign, though it sometimes precedes the sun and
sometimes follows it. Lowest of the five planets and
nearest to the earth is the star of Venus, called in
Greek Phosphoros (the light—bringer) and in Latin
Lucifer when it precedes the sun, but when it
follows it Hesper-053 this planet completes its orbit
in a year, traversing the zodiac with a zigzag move-

more than the space of two signs from the sun, though
sometimes in front of it and sometimes behind it.

planets, we cannot fail to enrol even them among
the number of the gods.
