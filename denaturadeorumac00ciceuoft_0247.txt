DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xxxvii.

together at haphazard and by chance, the world
has emerged complete, or rather a countless number

of worlds are some of them being born and some
perishing at every moment of time———yet if the
clash of atoms can create a world, why can it not
produce a colonnade, a temple, a house, a city, which

are less and indeed much less difficult things to make ?
The fact is, they indulge in such random babbling
about the world that for my part I cannot think
that they have ever looked up at this marvellously
beautiful sky—which is my next topic. So Aristotle

95 says ⁰ brilliantly z ‘ If there were beings who had al- Only

ways lived beneath the earth, in comfortable, well—lit {alr-ugin-'ity
dwellings, decorated with statues and pictures and &hiendijffietc
furnished with all the luxuries enjoyed by persons {ffiffiffs of
thought to be supremely happy, and who though they

had never come forth above the ground had learnt

by report and by hearsay of the existence of certain
deities or divine powers ; and then if at some time
the jaws of the earth were opened and they were able

to escape from their hidden abode and to come forth
into the regions which we inhabit ; when they sud-
denly had sight of the earth and the seas and the sky,

and came to know of the vast clouds and mighty
winds, and beheld the sun, and realized not only its
size and beauty but also its potency in causing the
day by shedding light over all the sky, and, after
night had darkened the earth, they then saw the
whole sky spangled and adorned with stars, and the
changing phases of the moon’s light, now waxing and
now waning, and the risings and settings of all these
heavenly bodies and theirO courses fixed and change-

less throughout all eternsty, ——when they saw these

things, surely they would think that the gods exist
