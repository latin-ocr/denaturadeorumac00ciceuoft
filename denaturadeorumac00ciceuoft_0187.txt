DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xiii.

deniable that every organic whole must have an ulti· All, things
mate ideal of perfectiori. As in vines or in cattle we ζξῗςζῖὧῗῃ,
see that, unless obstructed by some force, nature pro- bu?
gresses on a certain path of her own to her goal of full ἶῘ-Ἶὲζῗὲεεῗιιοηο
development, and as in painting, architecture and the canattam it·
other arts and crafts there is an ideal of perfect work-
manship, even so and far more in the world of nature
as a whole there must be a process towards complete-
ness and perfection. The various limited modes of
being may encounter many externa] obstacles to
hinder their perfect realization, but there can be
nothing that can frustrate nature as a whole, since
she embraces and contains within herself all modes
of being. Hence it follows that there must exist
this fourth and highest grade, unassailable by any

36 external force. Now this is the grade on which The world,
universal nature stands3 and since she is of such a ’.Ἰ-ςξῡῖἰῧᾶῑῦ·
character as to be superior to all things and incapable ὲῖῗηῖνε and
of frustration by any, it follows of necessity that the gliielxxfore
world is an intelligent being, and indeed also a wise ε’ψπῖωθῐγ
being· {gggesgmsn

‘⁴ Again, what can be more illogical than to deny ὲζῑξὲἱῖῗῑ and

that the being which embraces all things must be the y,
best of all things, or, admitting this, to deny that it
must be, first, possessed of life, secondly, rational and
intelligent, and lastly, endowed with wisdom ? How
else can it be the best of all things ? If it resembles
plants or even animals, so far from being highest, it
must be reckoned lowest in the scale of being. If
again it be capable of reason yet has not been wise
from the beginning, the world must be in a worse
condition than mankind 3 for a man can become wise,
but if in all the eternity of past time the world has

been foolish, obviously it will never attain wisdom3
G 157
