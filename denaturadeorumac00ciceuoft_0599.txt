that it is possible but that it is the duty of the wise
man, had not only never been distinctly formulated
but had never even been stated by any of his pre-
decessors 3 but Arcesilas deemed this view both true
and also honourable and worthy of a wise man. We
may suppose him putting the question to Zeno, what
would happen if the wise man was unable to perceive
anything and if also it was the mark of the wise man
not to form an opinion. Zeno no doubt replied that
the wise man's reason for abstaining from forming
an opinion would be that there was something that

Arcesilas. A presentation, was doubtless the answer.
Then what sort of a presentation? Hereupon no
doubt Zeno defined it as follows, a presentation 'un-
pressed and scaled and moulded from a real object,
in conformity with its reality. There followed the
further question, did this hold good even if a true
presentation was of exactly the same form as a false
one ? At this I imagine Zeno was sharp enough to
see that if a presentation proceeding from a real
thing was of such a nature that one proceeding from
a non-existent thing could be of the same form, there
was no presentation that could be perceived. Ar-
cesilas agreed that this addition to the definition was
correct, for it was impossible to perceive either a false
presentation or a true one if a true one had such a
character as even a false onc might have3 but he
pressed the points at issue further in order to show
that no presentation proceeding from a true object

one argument that has held the field down to the
present day. For the point that the wise man will
