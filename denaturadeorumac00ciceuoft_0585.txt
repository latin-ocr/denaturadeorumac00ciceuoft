But just as I deem it supremely honourable to hold
true views, so it is supremely disgraceful to approve
falsehoods as true. And nevertheless Ι myself am
not the sort of person never to give approval to any-

Phoenicians place their trust by night
To guide them on the deep,

as Aratus ὃ puts it, and steer the straighter because
they keep to her who

revolves upon
An inner circle and an orbit brief,

but by Helice and the resplendent Septentriones,
that is, by these theories of wider aspect, not fined

roam and wander more wide1y3 but it is not I, as Ι
said, but the wise man that is the subject of our
inquiry. For when the presentations you talk of
have struck my mind or my sense sharply I accept
them, and sometimes I actually give assent to them

agreeing with Zeno, lies in avoiding being taken in
and in seeing that he is not deceived——for nothing is
more removed from the conception that we have of
