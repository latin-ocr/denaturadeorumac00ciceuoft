in the construction first of every animaLthen most of all
in man,—the power possessed by the senses, the way
in which we are first struck by the sense-presenta-
tions, next follows appetition α imparted by their im-
pact, and then we direct the senses to perceive the
objects. For the mind itself, which is the source of
the sensations and even is itself sensaffion, has a
natural force which it directs to the things by which
it is moved. Accordingly some sense-presentations
it seizes on so as to make use of them at once, others
it as it were stores away, these being the source
of memory, while all the rest it unites into systems
by their mutual resemblances, and from these are
formed the concepts of obj ects which the Greeks term
sometimes ennoiaz' and sometimes prolepseis. &Vhen
thereto there has been added reason and logical proof
and an innumerable multitude of facts, then comes
the clear perception of all these things, and also this

mind of man is supremely well adapted for the know-

information very readily, and your catale‘psz's, which

nothing is dearer to the mind than the light of truth)
and also for the sake of its utility. Hence the mind
employs the senses, and also creates the sciences as a
second set of senses, and strengthens the structure of
philosophy itself to the point where it may produce
virtue, the sole source of the ordering of the whole of
life. Thfflefore those who assert that nothing can be
grasped deprive us of these things that are the very
