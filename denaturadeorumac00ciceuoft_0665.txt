ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (LucutLus), xl.—xli.

fictions t it is better to have no opinions than to have
126 such wrong ones! ’ Oh, then, the object is not to
get me to give the approval of my assent to something
—a demand which it is surely actually impudent
and not merely arrogant for you to make, especially
as these dogmas of yours don’t seem to me even
probable 3 for Ι don't as a matter of fact think that
there is any such thing as the divination which your
school accepts, and I make light of the existence of
that destiny which your school declares to be the
bond that holds the universe together—I do not even
dcem that this world was built on a divine plan 3 and
yet it may be so. XLI. But why am I dragged Yetthe
into disfavour? may I have your leave not to {fflfi’r'ffias
know what I do not know? Are the Stoics to be moralvalua
allowed to dispute among themselves but nobody
allowed to dispute with the Stoics ? Zeno and almost
all the other Stoics think the aether a supreme deity,
endowed with a mind whereby the universe is ruled,
Cleanthes, the Stoic of the older families as it were,
who was a disciple of Zeno, holds that the sun is lord
and master of the world ; thus the disagreement of
the wise compels us to be ignorant of our own lord,
inasmuch as we do not know whether we are the
servants of the sun or of the aether. Then the size
of the sun—for this radiant sun himself seems to be
gazing at me, reminding me to keep mentioning him
—your school then report his size as if you had
measured it with a ten-foot rule, while I declare that I
mistrust this measurement of yours as I distrust in-
competent architects t then is it doubtful which of us
127 is—to speak frivolously—the more modest? And
all the same 1 do not think that these physical in·-
vestigations of yours should be put out of bounds.
