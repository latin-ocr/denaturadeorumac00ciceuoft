ACADEMICA, I. iii.

in many departments that is enough to stimulate
the student though not enough to complete his
10 instruction. But though it is true that the case you
bring forward has some probability, as accomplished
students on the one hand will prefer to read the
Greek writings, and on the other hand people who
do not know those will not read these either, still,
tell me now—do you quite prove your point ? The
truth rather is that both those who cannot read the
Greek books will read these and those who can read
the Greek will not overlook the works of their own
nation. For what reason is there why accomph'shed
Grecians should read Latin poets and not read Latin
philosophers ? Is it because they get pleasure from
Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius and many others, who have
reproduced not the words but the meaning of the
Greek poets? How much more pleasure will they
get from philosophers, if these imitate Plato, Aristotle
and Theophrastus in the same way as those poets
imitated Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides? At
all events I see that any of our orators that have
imitated Hyperides or Demosthenes are praised.
11 But for my own part (for Ι will speak frankly), so long
as Ι was held entangled and fettered by the multi-
farious duties of ambition‚ office, litigation, political
interests and even some politica] responsibility, I used
to keep these studies within close bounds, and relied
merely on reading, when I had the opportunity,
to revive them and prevent their fading away ; but
now that I have been smitten by a grievously heavy
blowa of fortune and also released from taking part
in the government of the country, Ι seek from philo-
sophy a cure for my grief and I deem this to be
the most honourable mode of amusing my leisure.
