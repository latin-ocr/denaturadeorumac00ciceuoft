more familiar and manageable by handling), and that
out of it all things have been formed and produced,
so that this matter can in its totality receive all
things and undergo every sort of transformation
throughout every part of it, and in fact even suffer
dissolution, not into nothingness but into its own
parts, which are capable of infinite section and division,
since there exists nothing whatever in the nature of
things that is an absolute least, incapable of division ;
but that all things that are in motion move by
means of interspaces,‘² these likewise being infinitely

‘ quality ' ⁶ moves in this manner and since it thus

matter also is itself in a state of complete change
throughout, and is made into the things which they

whole of substance‚‘² a continuum united with all its
parts, has been produced one world, outside of which
there is no portion of matter and no body, while all

the things that fall within its province, governing
especially the heavenly bodies, and then those things
on earth that concern mankind ; and this force they
