ACADEMICA, II. (Lm-otrus), xxiii.

72 XXIII. ‘⁴ And first let us see what we are to make (2) Reply'to
ot your remark at the beginning‚‘⁷l that our way of &getulium
recalling ancient philosophers was like the sedition- ὃξὲὓῐᾞξῃ-ῖῑ
mongers' habit of putting forward the names of per· ssolpissesssoare
sons who are men of distinction but yet of popular {gssgtyim
leanings. Those people although they have unworthy
designs in hand desire to appear like men of worth ;
and we in our turn declare that the views we hold
are ones that you yourselves admit to have been
approved by the noblest of philosophers. Anaxagoras
saidb that snow is black: would you endure me if
I said the same ? Not you, not even if I expressed
myself as doubtful. But who is this Anaxagoras?
surely not a sophist (for that is the name that used
to be given to people who pursued philosophy for
the sake of display or profit) ? Why, he was a man

ι13 of the highest renown for dignity and intellect. Why
should I talk about Democritus ? Whom can we com-
pare for not only greatness of intellect but also great·
ness of soul, with one who dared to begin, ‘These
are my utterances about the universe ’⁰ ?—he excepts
nothing as not covered by his pronouncement, for
what can be outside the universe? Who does not
place this philosopher before Cleanthes or Chrysippus
or the rest of the later period, who compared with
him seem to me to belong to the fifth class ἆ ? And
he does not mean what we mean, who do not deny
that some truth exists but deny that it can be per-
ceived ; he flatly denies that truth exists at all; and
at the same time says that the senses are (not dim

but) ‘ full of darkness ' 0—for that is the term he uses

occurs here only. Horace, Sat. 1. ii. 47, has ‘in classe
secundhar ’ of ‘ second-class ’ merchandise.
