DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxv.—xxvi.

55 it is he then who is addressed by Ennius in the follow·
ing terms, as I said before ‘² ε

Behold this dazzling vault of heaven, which all mankind
as Jove invoke-—

more explicitly than in another passage of the same
poet :

Now by whatever ow'r it be that sheds
This light of day, f‘ll lay my curse upon him 2

It is he also whom our augurs mean by their formula
‘ should Jove lighten and thunder,' meaning ‘ should
the sky lighten and thunder.' Euripides among many
fine passages has this brief invocation z

Thou seest the boundless aether’s spreading vault.
XVhose soft embrace encompasseth the earth :
This deem thou god of gods, the supreme J ove.⁶

56 XXVI. “ The air, lying between the sea and sky, is
according to the Stoic theory deified under the name
belonging to J uno,⁶ sister and wife of Jove, because
it resembles and is closely connected with the
aether3 they made it female and assigned it to J uno
because of its extreme softness. (The name of J uno
however I believe to be derived from iuvare ‘ to help ⁹).
There remained water and earth, to complete the
fabled partition of the three kingdoms. Accordingly
the second kingdom, the entire realm of the sea, was
assigned to Neptune, J ove’s brother as they hold 3
his name is derived from nare ‘ to swim,' with a slight
alteration of the earlier letters and with the suffix
seen in Portunus (the harbour god), derived from
portus ‘ a harbour.' The entire bulk and substance of
the earth was dedicated to father Dis (that is, Dives,
‘ the rich,’ and so in Greek Plouton), because all things
fall back into the earth and also arise from the earth.
