DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xxxiv.—xxxv.

five planets that take place in the heavens every
twenty-four hours, would any single native doubt that
this orrery was the work of a rational being ? XXXV.
These thinkers however raise doubts about the world
itself from which all things arise and have their being,
and debate whether it is the product of chance or
necessity of some sort, or of divine reason and intelli-
gence 3 they think more highly of the achievement
of Archimedes in making a model of the revolutions
of the firmament than of that of nature in creating
thern, although the perfection of the original shows
a craftsmanship many times as great as does the
39 counterfeit. Just as the shepherd in Accius ‘² who had
never seen a ship before, on descrying in the distance
stom his mountain-top the strange vessel of the
ArgonautS, built by the gods, in his first amazement
and alarm cries out z
so huge a bulk

Glides from the deep with the roar of a whistling wind ε

VVaves roll before, and eddies surge and swirl ;

Hurtling headlong, it snorts and sprays the foam.

Now might one deem a bursting storm-cloud rolled,

Now that a rock flew skyward‚ flung alost

By wind and storm, or whirling waterspout

Rose from the clash of wave with warring wave;

Save ’twere land—havoc wrought by ocean-flood‚

Or T riton's trident, heaving up the roots

Of cavernous vaults beneath the billowy sea,
Hurled from the depth heaven-high a massy crag.

At first he wonders what the unknown creature that
he beholds may be. Then when he sees the warriors
and hears the singing of the sailors, he goes on :

the sportive dolphins swift
Forge snorting through the foam—

and so on and so on—
