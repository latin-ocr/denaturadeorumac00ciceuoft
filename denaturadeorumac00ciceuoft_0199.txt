even in matters of taste you Epicureans have a
criterion of your oum Ξ However, assuming that the
figures which you mention are more beautiful to the
eye—though for my part I don’t think them so, for
what can be more beautiful than the figure that en-

surface‚ no indentation or concavity, no protuberance
or depression ? There are two forms that excel

have never meddled with that learned dust,‘² could
you not have grasped even so much of natural philo-

nothing could be more unscientific than your favourite
assertion, that it is not certain that our world itself is
