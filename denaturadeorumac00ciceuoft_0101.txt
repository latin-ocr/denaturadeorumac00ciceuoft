DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xxvi.

amaster !—and some people think that he did, but he
himself denies it, and he ought to know 1 He states
that he heard a certain Pamphilus, a pupil of Plato, at
Samos (where he resided in his youth with his father
and brother—his father Neocles had gone there to
take up land,but failing to make aliving out of his farm,

{3 Ι believe kept a school). However Epicurus pours
endless scorn on this Platonist, so afraid is he of
appearing ever to have learnt anything from a teacher.
He stands convicted in the case of Nausiphanes, a
follower of Democritus, whom he does not deny he
heard lecture, but whom nevertheless he assails with
every sort of abuse. Yet if he had not heard from
him these doctrines of Democritus, what had he
heard ? for what is there in Epicurus’s natural philo-
sophy that does not come from Democritus ? Since
even if he introduced some alterations, for instance
the swerve of the atoms, of which I spoke just now,
yet most of his system is the same, the atoms, the void,
the images, the infinity of space, and the countless
number of worlds, their births and their destructions,
in fact almost everything that is compi-ised in natural
selence.

14 “ As to your formula ‘ a semblance of body ’ and
⁸ a semblance of blood,’ what meaning do you attach
to it? That you have a better knowledge of the
matter than I have I freely admit, and what is more,
am quite content that this should be so ; but once it
is expressed in words, why should one of us be able
to understand it and not the other? Well then, I do
understand what body is and what blood is, but what
⁸ a semblance of body ’ and ‘ a semblance of blood ’
are I don't understand in the very least. You are
not trying to hide the truth from me, as Pythagoras
