DE NATURA DEORUM, 1. xxiv.

there are certain minute particles‚ some smooth,
others rough, some round, some angular, some curved
or hook-shaped, and that heaven and earth were
created from these, not by compulsion of any natural
law but by a sort of accidental colliding——this is the
belief to which y,ou Gaius Velleius, have clung all
your life long, and it would be easier to make?> you
alter all your principles of conduct than abandon the
teachings of your master3 for you made up your
mind that Epicureanism claimed youi allegiance
before you learned these doctrines: so th at y ou were
faced with the alternative of either accepting these
outrageous notions or surrendering the title of the
'›7 school of your adoption. For what would you
take to cease to be an Epicurean? ‘For no con-
sideration‚’ you reply, ‘ would I forsake the principles
of happiness and the truth.' Then is Epicure-anism
the truth ? For as to happiness I don't join issue, since
in your view even divine happiness involves being
bored to death with idleness. But where is the truth
to be found? I suppose in an infinite number of
worldS, some coming to birth and others hurled into
ruin at every minutest moment of time ? or in the
indivisible particles that produce all the marvels of
creation without any controlling nature or reason?
But I am forgetting the indulgence which I began to
show you just now, and am taking too wide a range.
I will grant therefore that everything is made out of
indivisible bodies3 but this takes us no fai-ther, for
58 we are trying to discover the nature of the gods. Sup- imncon atie nt
pose we allow that the gods are made of atoms: then viltl dl*
it follows that they are not eter nal. For what' is made1¹ ῑξγῐ, monas-¹⁹
