DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙΙ. xxix.—xxx.

How I’m to cheat him, what to lcvy off him,
What plot to plan or trick to play upon him,
I can't imagine : all my tricks and dodges
My father's generosity has out-tricked.

Well then, how can those plots and devices, those
dodges and tricks have come into existence with-
out reasoning ? What a noble gift of the gods, that
enables Phormio to say :

Produce the old boy—my plans are all prepared !
14 XXX. “ But let us quit the theatre and visit the law- and from

courtS. The praetor is about to take his seat. What {ssfissff‘
is the trial to be about ? To find out who set fire to
the record office. How could you have a craftier crime ?
yet Quintus Socius, a distinguished Roman knight,
confessed he had done it. To find out who tampered
with the public accounts. Well, this again was done
by Lucius Alenus, when he forged the handwriting
of the six senior treasury clerks; what could be
craftier than this fellow ? Note other trials—the
affair of the gold from Toulouse,“ Jugurtha's con-
spiracy ; go back to an earlier period, and take the
trial of Tubulus for giving a bribed verdjct, or to a
later one, and take the trial for incest on Peducaeus ’s
motion, and then the trials under the new law, the
cases of assassination, poisom'ng, embezzlement and
forgery of wius, that are daily occurrences at the
present time. Reason is the source of the charge
⁴ I declare that with your aid and counsel a theft was
committed ' ; hence spring all the trials for breach of
trust as to a guardianship, commission, in virtue of
partnership‚trusteeship‚ and all the other cases arising
from breach of saith in purchase or sale or hire or lease3

hence procedure on the public bchalf in a private suit
