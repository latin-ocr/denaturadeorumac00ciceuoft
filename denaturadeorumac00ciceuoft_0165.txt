DE NATURA DEORUM, II. iv.

books it had come to his mind that there had been
an irregularity when he took Scipio's park as the site
for his augural tent, for he had subsequently entered
the city bounds to hold a meeting of the Senate and
when crossing the bounds again on his return had for-
gotten to take the auspices ‘² 3 and that therefore the
consuls had not been duly elected. The College of
Augurs referred the matter to the Senate ; the Senate
decided that the consuls must resign3 they did so.
What more striking instances can we demand? A
man of the greatest wisdom and Ι may say unrivalled
distinction of character preferred to make public con-
fession of an offence that he might have concealed
rather than that the stain of impiety should cling to
the commonwealth 3 the consuls preferred to retire
on the spot from the highest office of the state rather
than hold it for one moment of time in violation of
12 religion. The augur’s office is one of high dignity ;
surely the soothsayer's art also is divinely inspired.
Is not one who considers these and countless similar
facts compelled to admit that the gods exist ? If there
be persons who interpret the will of certain beings,
it follows that those beings must themselves exist3
but there are persons who interpret the will of the
gods; therefore we must admit that the gods exist.
But perhaps it may be argued that not all prophecies
come true. Nor do all sick persons get well,but that
does not prove that there is no art of medicine. Signs
of future events are manifested by the gods; men
may have mistaken these signs, but the fault lay With
man’s powers of inference, not with the divine nature.
“Hence the main issue is agreed among all men
of all nations, inasmuch as all have engraved in
their minds an innate belief that the gods exist.
