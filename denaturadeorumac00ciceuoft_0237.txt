DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxxiii.-xxxiv.

kinds of matter. For earth turns into water, water
into air, air into aether, and then the process is re-
versed, and aether becomes air, air water, and water
earth, the lowest of the four. Thus the parts of the
world are held in union by the constant passage u
and down, to and fro, of these four elements of xx ghicfi
85 all things are composed. And this world— structure
must either be everlasting' ln this same form m which
we see it or at all events extremely durable, and des-

true, the inference follows that the world is governed
by nature. For consider the navigation of a fleet, the
marshalling of an army, or (to return to instances
from the processes of nature) the budding of a vine
or of a tree, or even the shape and structure of the
limbs of an animal—when do these ever evidence
such a degree of skill in nature as does the world
itself ? Either therefore there is nothing that is ruled
by a sentient nature, or we must admit that the
86 world is so ruled. Indeed, how is it possible that the
universe, which contains within itself all the other
natures and their seeds, should not itself be governed
by nature? Thus if anyone declared that a man’s
teeth and the hair on his body are a natural growth
but that the man himself to whom they belong is not
a natural organism, he would fail to see that things
which produce something from within them must
have more perfect natures than the things which are
produced from them. XXXIV. But the sower and
planter and begetter, so to speak, of all the things
that nature governs, their trainer and nourisher, is
the world ; the world gives nutriment and sustenance
to all its limbs as it were, or parts. But if the parts
