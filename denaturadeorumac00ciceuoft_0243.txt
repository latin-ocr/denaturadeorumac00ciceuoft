DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxxv.—xxxvi.

Brings to my ears and hearing such a tune
As old Silvanus piped.

90 Well then, even as the shepherd at the first sight
thinks he sees some lifeless and inanimate object, but
afterwards is led by clearer indications to begin to
suspect the true nature of the thing about which he
had previously been uncertain, so it would have been
the proper course for the philosophers, if it so hap-
pened that the first sight of the world perplexed them,
afterwards when they had seen its definite and regular
motions‚ and all its phenomena controlled by fixed
system and unchanging uniformity, to infer the
presence not merely of an inhabitant of this celestia]
and divine abode, but also of a ruler and governor, the
architect as it were of this mighty and monumenta]
structure.

XXXVI. “ But as it is they appear to me to have
no suspicion even of the marvels of the celestial and

91 terrestria] creation. For in the first place the earth,
which is situated in the centre of the world, is sur-
rounded on all sides by this living and respirable
substance named the air. ‘Air ’ is a Greek word, but
yet it has by this time been accepted in use by our
race, and in fact passes current as Latin. The air in
turn is embraced by the immeasurable aether, which
consists of the most elevated portions of fire. The
term ‘ aether ' also we may borrow, and employ it
like ‘air' as a Latin word, though Pacuvius provides
his readers with a translation :

What Iffpeak of, we call heaven, but the Greeks it ‘ aether’
ca -.

just as though the man who says this were not a
Greek! ‘Well, he is talking Latin,’ you may say.
