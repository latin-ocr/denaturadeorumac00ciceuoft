DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xxxviii.—xxxix.

tion of a certain form—surely not also of a reason for
supposing that this form is happy and eternal?

“ But what is the nature of these images of yours,
and whence do they arise? This extravagance‚ it
is true, is borrowed from Democritus3 but he has
been widely criticized, nor can you find a satisfactory
explanation, and the whole affair is a lame and
impotent business. For what can be more improb·
able than that images of Homer, Archilochus,
Romulus, Numa, Pythagoras and Plato should im-
pinge on me at all—much less that they should do
so in the actual shape that those men really bore ?
How then do those images arise ? and of whom are
they the images ? Aristotle α tells us that the poet
Orpheus never existed, and the Pythagoreans say
that the Orphie poem which we possess was the work
of a certain Cercops ; yet Orpheus, that is, according

person enter my mind and yours? or that images
come to us of things that never existed at all and

Chimaera ? or of people, places and cities which we
have never seen ? What of the fact that I can call
up an image instantaneously, the very moment that
I choose to do so ? or that they come to me unbidden,
even when I am asleep ? Velleius, the whole affair
is humbug. Yet you stamp these images not only
on our eyes but also on our minds—so irresponsibly l‘iffltssl,
