DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xiii—xiv.

senses receive pleasant sensations and not receive
their opposites 3 if therefore it is capable of feeling
pleasure, it is also capable of feeling pain; but a
being which can experience pleasure must necessarily
also be liable to destruction3 therefore it must be
admitted that every living thing is liable to death.

33 Besides, if there be anything that cannot feel either (v.) pos-
pleasure or pain, this cannot be a living thing, and 15,ῗέξῖξὲ

trary ; and every living thing seeks certain things and
flees from certain things, but that which it flees
from is contrary to nature, and that which is con-

pleasure and pain, and the rest, when felt in an
intense degree cause destruction3 nor is any living
thing devoid of sensation ; therefore no living thing
is everlasting. XIV. For every living thing must (m) oom-
