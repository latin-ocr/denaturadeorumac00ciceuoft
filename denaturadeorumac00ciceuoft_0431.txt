ACADEMICA
INTRODUCTION

DATES OF COMPOSITION AND {hammon—In Cicero’s
letters to Atticus written during the summer of
45 B.c., when he was in retirement from public life
(see p. xi), there are many references to his work
on this treatise. Writing from Astura on May 13,
and alluding to the death of his daughter, he says :
‘ Ego hic duo magna συντάγματα absolvi 3 nullo enim
alio modo a miseria quasi aberrare possum ' (Att.
xii. 45. 1). On May 29, he writes from Tusculum
(Att. xiii. 32. 3): ‘ Torquatus Romaest ; misi ut tibi
daretur. Catulum et Lucullum ut opinor antea;
his libris nova prohoemia sunt addita quibus eorum
uterque laudatur.' Here ‘ Torquatus ' means the
first two books of De Finibus, and ‘Catulus ’ the
first and ‘ Lucullus ' the second book of Academica
in its first shape ; so it is the latter treatise‚ and not
De F inibus I. and 11.‚ that is probably referred to by
the modest expression in the preceding quotation
‘ two big compilations.’ We infer that Academica
in its first form was so far finished by the latter half
of May that a copy was sent to Atticus, new prefaces
being added a little later. Cicero refers to the treatise
