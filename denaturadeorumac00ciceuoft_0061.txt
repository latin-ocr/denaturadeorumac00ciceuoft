DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. itt—xii.

fulness or lapse of time3 and he also deifies the stars,
but this has been criticized in another philosopher
and need not be dealt with now in the case of
29 Parmenides. XII. Empedocles again among many
other blunders comes to grief most disgracefully in
his theology. He assigns divinity to the four sub-
stances which in his system are the constituent
elements of the universe, although manifestly these
substances both come into and pass out of existence,
and are entirely devoid of sensation. Protagoras also,
who declares he has no clear views whatever about the
gods, whether they exist or do not exist, or what
they are like, seems to have no notion at all of the
divine nature. Then in what a maze of error is
Democritus ‘² involved, who at one moment ranks as
gods his roving ‘ images,' at another the substance
that emits and radiates these images, and at another
again the scientific intelligence of man Ξ At the same
time his denial of immutability, and therefore of
eternity, to everything whatsoever surely involves a
repudiation of deity so absolute as to leave no con-
ception of a divine being remaining! Diogenes of
Apollonia makes air a god; but how can air
30 have sensation, or divinity in any shape ? The in-
consistencies of Plato are a long story. In the
Timaeusb he says that it is impossible to name the
father of this universe; and in the Laws ⁰ he depre-
cates all inquiry into the nature of the deity.
Again,‘² he holds that god is entirely incorporea]
(in Greek, asomatos); but divine incorporeity is
inconceivable, for an incorporea] deity would
necessarily be incapable of sensation, and also
of practical wisdom, and of pleasure, all of which

⁴ This sentence should probably follow :he next one.
