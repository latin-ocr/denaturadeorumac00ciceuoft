defence of perspicuity, and to be armed so that we
may be able to meet their arguments and shatter
their captions; and this I have decided on as my
47 next step. I will therefore set out their arguments
in classified form, since even they themselves make a
practice of orderly exposition. They first attempt
to show the possibility that many things may appear
to exist that are absolutely non-existent, since the
mind is deceptively affected by non-existent objects
in the same manner as it is affected by real ones. For,
they say, when your school asserts that some presenta-
tions are sent by the deity—dreams for example, and
the revelations furnished by oracles, auspices and
sacrifices (for they assert that the Stoics against whom
they are arguing accept these manifestations)—how
possibly, they ask, can the deity have the power to
render false presentations probable and not have
the power to render probable those which approxi-
mate absolutely most closely to the truth ? or
else, if he is able to render these also probable,
why cannot he render probable those which are dis-
tinguishable, although only with extreme difficulty,
from false presentations ? and if these, why not
48 those which do not differ from them at all? Then,
since the mind is capable of entirely sels-originated
motion, as is manifest by our faculty of mental im-
agination and by the visions that sometimes appear to
men either when asleep or mad, it is probable that the
mind may also be set in motion in such a manner that
not only it cannot distinguish whether the presenta-
tions in question are true or false but that there really
is no difference at all between them : just as if people
were to shiver and turn pale either of themselves as
a result of some mental emotion or in consequence
