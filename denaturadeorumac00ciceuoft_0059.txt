DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xi.

But mind is itself the innermost principle. Mind
therefore will have an outer integument of body.
27 But this Anaxagoras will not allow ; yet mind naked
and simple, without any material adjunct to serve
as an organ of sensation, seems to elude the capacity
of our understanding. Alcmaeon of Croton, who
attributed divinity to the sun, moon and other
heavenly bodies, and also to the soul, did not perceive
that he was bestowing immortality on things that
are mortal. As for Pythagoras, who believed that
the entire substance of the universe is penetrated
and pervaded by a soul of which our souls are frag-
ments, he failed to notice that this severance of the
souls of men from the world-soul means the dis-
memberment and rending asunder of god3 and that
when their souls are unhappy, as happens to most men,
then a portion of god is unhappy 3 which is impossible.
28 Again, if the soul of man is divine, why is it not
omniscient? Moreover, if the Pythagorean god is
pure soul, how is he implanted in, or diffused through-
out, the world? Next, Xenophanes endowed the uni-
verse with mind, and held that, as being infinite, it
was god. His view of mind is as open to objection
as that of the rest3 but on the subject of infinity
he incurs still sever-er criticism‚ for the infinite can
have no sensation and no contact with anything
outside. As for Parmenides, he invents a purely
fanciful something resembling a crown—-steplzane
is his name for it—, an unbroken ring of glowing li ghts ‚
encircling the sky, which he entitles god3 but no
one can imagine this to possess divine form, or
sensation. He also has many other portentous
notions; he deifies war, strife, lust and the like, things
which can be destroyed by disease or sleep or forget-
