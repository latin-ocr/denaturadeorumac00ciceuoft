INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

in his youth had listened eagerly to his oratory
(Brutus, 305, 317) ; he had been banished in 90 B.c.
under the Varian law (De Or. iii. 11), had returned to
Rome 82 13.c. (Brut. 311), and became consul 75 B.c.
and then proconsul of Gaul, but died before his
triumph. Cicero is almost 3 κωφὸν πρόσωπον ; in the
Introduction (i. 16 f.) he makes a complimentary reply
to Cotta's greeting, and one other short remark when
Velleius says that as another pupil of Philo he will be
a valuable ally for Cotta. Cotta in his reply to the
Epicurean exposition asks leave (ii. 104) to quote
Cicero’s translation of the astronomical poem of
Aratus, but Cicero gives his consent by silence. At
the close of the work (iii. 95) Cicero ends by noting the
impression that the debate had made on his own mind.

SUPPOSED DATE or THE Damnum—The imaginary
scene of the dialogue may be dated in 77 or 76 B.c.
In a list of political murders given by Cotta (iii. 60)
the latest is that of Q. Scaevola, which was in 82 B.c.
The Stoic professor Posidonius is spoken of as ‘ the
friend of us all ’ (i. 123), which seems to put the scene
after 78 B.c. when Cicero heard him lecture at Rhodes
(although he had visited Rome on an embassy from
Rhodes in 86 Re.) 3 but there is no reference to
Cotta's consulship, 7 5 B.c. The date suggested fits
in with the reference to P. Vatinius as ‘ adulescens '
(ii. 6); he became quaestor in 63 13.c. when Cicero
was consul.

SOURCES OF N .D.—It is of interest to try to ascertain
the sources from which Cicero gets his materials for
the treatise. In the Epicurean's review of the earlier
Greek philosophers (i. 25-41) there are references to
their works, and later there are allusions to Epicurus’s
writings (ξ 43 Περὶ Κριτηρίουῆ Κανών, ‘ a heavenly
