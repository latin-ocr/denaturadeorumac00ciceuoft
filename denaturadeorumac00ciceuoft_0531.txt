how pray could we act on them ? how morcover could
we see what is consistent with any given fact and
what inconsistent? At all events no place at all is
left for memory, the one principal foundation not
only of philosophy but of all the conduct of life and
all the sciences. For how can there possibly be a
memory of what is false? or what can anyone re-
member that he does not grasp and hold in his mind ?
But what science can there be that is not made up of
not one 1101· two but many mental percepts ? And if
you take away science, how will you distinguish be-
tween the craftsmanss and the ignoramus ? for we shall
not pronounce one man to be a craftsman, and the
other not, just casually, but when we see the one
retain what he has perceived and grasped, and the
other not. And as one class of sciences is of such 3
nature as only to envisage facts mentally, and another
such as to do or to make something, how can the
geometrician 6111 isage things that are either non-
existent or indistinguishablet> from fictitious things, or
the player on the harp round off his rhythms and
complete his verses? and the same result will also
occur in the other crafts of the same class which are
solely exercised in making and doing, for what can
be effected by 3 craft unless its intending practitioner
has accumulated many percepts. Ρ
