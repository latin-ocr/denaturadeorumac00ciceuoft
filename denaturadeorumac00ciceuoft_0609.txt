ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (Luc-umus), xxvi—xxvii.

Geminus Quintus to appear to you, what reason have
you for being satisfied that a person who is not Cotta
cannot appear to you to be Cotta, inasmuch as some-
thing that is not real appears to be real? You say
that everything is in a class of its own,‘² and that
nothing is the same as what some other thing is.
That is, it is true, a Stoic argument, and it is not a very
convincing one—that no hair or grain of sand is in all
respeets the same as another hair or grain. These
assertions can be refuted, but I don't want to fight ;
for it makes no difference to the point at issue whether
an object completely within sight does not differ at all
from another or cannot be distinguished from it even
if it does differ. But if so great a resemblance be-
tween human beings is impossible, is it also impossible
between statues? Tell me, could not Lysippus‚b by
means of the same bronze, the same blend of metals,
the same graver and all the other requisites, make a
hundred Alexanders of the same shape? then by
what mode of recognition would you tell them apart ?
:6 well, if Ι imprint a hundred seals with this ring on
lumps of wax of the same sort, will there possibly be
any mode of distinction to aid in recognizing them ?
Or will you have to seek out some jeweller, as you
found that poultry·keeper ⁰ at Delos who recognized
eggs? XXVII. But you call in the aid of art ἆ ῖο
plead in defence even of the senses. A painter sees
things that we do not, and a musical expert recog-
nizes a tune as soon as a flute-player has blown a
note. Well, does not this seem to tell against you,
if without great artistic acquirements, to which few
people‚ of our race indeed very few, attain, we are
unable either to see or to hear ? Again those were re·
markable points θ about the high artistic skill shown
