ACADEMICA, II. (Lucanus), xliii.

doctrine is true, the same verdict has to be passed
against the Old Academics and the Peripatetics.
Will Antiochus therefore agree with neither? or if
133 not, which of the two, say I, is the wiser? What
then? when Antiochus himself disagrees in some
things from these Stoic friends of his, does he not

I am afraid it is hardly consistent of him both to say

to hold that a man for whom these are his entire
environment will be happy if he is wise. I am dragged
in different directions—now the latter view seems to
