they do not persuade but convince, and who prove
all their propositions by their diagrams to the satis-
faction of your school. I am not asking these people
about those first principles of mathematics which
must be granted before they are able to advance
an inch—that a point is a thing without magnitude,
that a ‘ boundary ’ or surfacea is a thing entirely
devoid of thickness, a line a thing without any
breadth. When I have admitted the correctness of
these definitions, if I put the wise man on his oath,
and not until Archimedes has first, with him looking
on, drawn all the diagrams proving that the sun is
many times as large as the earth, do you think that
he will take the oath ? If he does, he m‘ll have shown
contempt for the sun itself which he deems is a
117 god. But if he is going to refuse credence to the
methods of geometry, which in their teaching exer·
cise a compelling force, as your school itself asserts,
surely he for his part will be far from believing
the proofs of the philosophers; or else, if he does
believe them, which school's proofs will he choose ?
for one might set out all the systems of the natural
philosophers, but it would be a long story : all the
same, I want to know which philosopher he follows.
Imagine that somebody is becoming a wise man now,
but is not one yet 3 what doctrine or system will he
select to adopt? although whichever one he does
select, the selection will be made by a man not
wise3 but suppose he be an inspired genius, which
single one among the natural philosophers will he
choose to approve? more than one he will not be
able to. Ι am not asking about problems of un-
limited vagueness 2 let us merely consider what
authority he will approve in respect of the elements
