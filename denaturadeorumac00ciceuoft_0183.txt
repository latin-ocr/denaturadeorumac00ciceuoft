DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xi.—-xii.

ruling principle of the world must necessarily possess
sensation and reason, and these in a more intense and
higher form. Hence it follows that the world pos—
sesses wisdom, and that the element which holds all
things in its embrace is pre-eminently and perfectly
rational, and therefore that the world is god, and all
the forces of the world are held together by the
divine nature.
“ Moreover that glowing heat of the world is far

purer and more brilliant and far more mobile, and
therefore more stimulating to the senses, than this
warmth of ours by which the things that we know are

and activity to the warmth by which the world is held

that motion is of two sorts, one spontaneous, the other
derived from without3 and that that which moves
of itself spontaneously is more divine than that which
has motion imparted to it by some force not its own.
The former kind of motion he deems to reside only in
the soul, which he considers to be the only source and
origin of motion. Hence, since all motion springs

from the world-beat, and since that heat moves spon-
