DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xix.

therefore have to admit to the list of gods oxen and
horses, ibises‚ hawks‚ asps, crocodiles, fishes, dogs‚
wolves, cats and many beasts besides. Or if we reject
these, we shall also reject those others from whom
48 their claim springs. What next? If Ino is to be
deemed divine, under the title of Leucothea in Greece

as Aegialeus, though the former name is commoner
in ancient literature)? if these are not divine, I
have my fears as to what will become of Ino, for the

and Trophonius divine? The Roman tax—sarmers,
finding that lands in Boeotia belonging to the im-

doubts can we feel about Codrus or any other persons
who fell fighting for their country’s freedom? if we
stick at this, we must reject the earlier cases too,
60 from which these follow. Also it is easy to see that
in most states the memory of brave men has been
