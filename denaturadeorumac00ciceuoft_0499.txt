ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (LUCULLUS), i.

able because military distinction was not particularly
anticipated from one who had spent his youth in
practice at the bar, and the long period ofhis quaestor-
ship peacefully in Asia, while Murena was carrying
on the war in Pontus.‘² But intellectual gifts that
even sui-passed belief had no need of the unschooled
training that is given by experience.⁶ Accordingly
after spending the whole of his journeyby land and sea
partly in cross-questioning those who were experts
and partly in reading military history, he arrived in
Asia a made general, although he had started from
Rome a tiro in military matters. For he had a memory
for facts that was positively inspired, although Hor-
tensius had a better memory for words, but Lucullus’s
memory was the more valuable‚ inasmuch as in the
conduct of business facts are of more assistance than
words 3 and this form of memory is recorded as having
been present in a remarkable degree in Themistocles,
whom we rank as easily the greatest man of Greece,
and of whom the story is told that when somebody ⁶
offered to impart to him the memoria technica that was
then first coming into vogue, he replied that he
would sooner learn to forget—no doubt this was be-
cause whatever he heard or saw remained fixed in his
memory. Gifted with such natural endowrnents,
Lucullus had also added the training which Themi-
stocles had despised‚ and thus he kept facts engraved
on his mind just as we enshrine in writing things
3 that we desire to record. Consequently he was so
great a commander in every class of warfare, battles,
sieges, sea-fights, and in the entire field of military
equipment and commissariat, that the greatest king ἆ
since the time of Alexander admitted that he had
discovered Lucullus to be a greater general than any
