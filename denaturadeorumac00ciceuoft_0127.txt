DE NATURA DEORUM, I. §noem—xxxvi.

Velleius, if once we embark on this line of argument,
see how far it takes us. You claimed it as axiomatic
that reason can only exist in human form 3 but some-
one else will claim that it can only exist in a terrestrial
creature, in one that has been born, has grown up,
has been educated, consists of a soul and a body
liable to decay and disease—in fine, that it can only
exist in a mortal man. If you stand out against each
of these assumptions, why be troubled about shape
only? Rational intelligence exists in man, as you
saw, only in conjunction with all the attributes that
I have set out ; yet you say that you can recognize
god even with all these attributes stripped off, pro-
vided that the outward form remains. This is not
to weigh the question, it is to toss up for what you

9 are to say. Unless indeed you happen never to have
observed this either, that not only in a man but even
in a tree whatever is superfluous or without a use
is harmful. What a nuisance it is to have a single
finger too many l Why is this ? Because, given five
fingers, there is no need of another either for appear-
ance or for use. But your god has got not merely
one finger more than he wants, but a head, neck,
spine, sides, belly, back, flanks, hands, feet, thighs,
legs. If this is to secure him immortality, what
have these members to do with life ? What has even
the face? It depends more on the brain, heart,
lungs and liver, for they are the abode of life: a
man's countenance and features have nothing to do
with his vitality.
