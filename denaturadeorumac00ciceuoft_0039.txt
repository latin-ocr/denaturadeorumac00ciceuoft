DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. iii.-iv.

by reason and by theory. IV. If again anyone asks ξῖιζζξῖξξέῗ
what motive has induced me so late in the day to ξὲζξΐζὲζθξξ
commit these precepts to writing, there is nothing apatriotic'
that I can explain more easily. I was languishing·{¹3¹1}{01¹}‚J1}{³01⁸¹

on the ground that they doubted the possibility of
conveying in Latin the teachings they had received
from the Greeks. In the matter of style however I

in richness of vocabulary the Greeks do not surpass us.

particular form of consolation 3 but the best way open
to me of enjoying even this consolation to the full
extent was to devote myself not only to reading
books but also to composing a treatise on the whole
