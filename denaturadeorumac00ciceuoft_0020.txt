INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

But there is nothing to prove that Cicero had read
these first-hand authorities, and it is more probable that
he followed his usual method of adapting his exposi-
tion of each division of his treatise from a single
recent writer. For the exposition of Epicureanisrn
which forms the first half of Book i. this was probably
a work of his master, Zeno. This conjecture has been
supported by a curious accident. Among the papyri
discovered at Herculaneum in 1752 is a mutilated
Epicurean treatise (fully published in a volume of
Herculanensz‘a in 1862) ; there is reason to assign this
to Zeno’s pupil, Philodemus ; and the fragments are
enough to show considerable agreement with N .D. i.
The Epicurean argument in N .D. i. has three parts ε
a general attack on the Platonic and Stoic cosmology,
a review of the older philosophers, and an exposition of
Epicurean theology. In the papyrus the first part is
lost,but it contains the two latter and they correspond
very closely with N .D., in spite of some differences ;
the two books even agree in quotations from Xeno-
phanes, Antisthenes, Aristotle, Chrysippus, and Dio-
genes of Babylon (N.D. i. ἓξ 31, 32, 33, 41). Mayor
thinks that both books take their topics and argu-
ments from Zeno, the teacher of both authors, and as
the historical review in both stops at the middle of
the second century 13.c.‚ Zeno's work may well have
been based in turn on one by his predecessor Apollo-
dorus.

Coming to the Academic Cotta’s criticism of Epi-
cureanism in the second half of Book i., the Stoic
Posidonius is referred to (i. 123) as ‘ the friend of us
all,' and his work On Nature is quoted as authority
for part of the argument, and may be the source of
