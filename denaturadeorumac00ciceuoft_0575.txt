adduce he has to apply practice t just as a mother
knows her twins apart by having familiai-ized her eyes,
so you m‘ll know them apart if you habituate your-
self. Are you aware that the likeness of one egg to
another is proverbial? yet we have been told that
at Delos at the time of its prosperity a number of
people were in the habit of keeping large numbers of
hens for trade purposes ; these poultry-keepers used
to be able to tell which hen had laid an egg by merely
58 looking at it. Nor does that go against us, for we are
content not to be able to know those eggs apart‚
since to agree that this egg is the same as that egg,
is nevertheless not the same thing as if there really
were no distinction between them3 for I possess a
standard enabling me to judge presentations to be
true when they have a character of a sort that false
ones could not have ; from that standard I may not
diverge a finger's breadth‚ as the saying is, lest I
should cause universal confusion. For not only the
knowledge but even the nature of true and false will
be done away with if there is no difference between
them, so that even the remark that you have a way
of occasionally making will be absurd—namely‚ that
what you assert is not that when presentations are
impressed on to the mind there is no difference be-
tween the imprints themselves, but that there is no
difference between their ‘ species,’ or so to say their
class-forms.⁰ As if forsooth presentations were not
judged with reference to their class, and will have
no reliability if the mark of truth and falsehood is

59 abolished. ¹ But the height of absurdity is your asser- Thegllgg 0 f031

you. In the first place how can you be unhamperedis 1snpe nse
