ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (Lucanus), v.

Xenophanes, and even Plato and Socrates. But
neither had Saturninus—to cite in particular the
name of the enemy of my family—any feature re-
sembling those men of old, nor can the chicanery of
Arcesilas be compared with the modesty of Demo-
critus.“ And nevertheless your natural philosophers
do rather rarely, when brought to a standstill at some
topic, cry out in an excited sort of manner—Empe-
docles indeed in a way that sometimes makes me
think him raving—saying that all things are hidden
and that we perceive nothing, discern nothing, are
utterly unable to discover the real nature of any-
thing3 although for the most part all your school
seem to me at all events to be only too confident in
some of their assertions and to profess to know more
15 than they really do. But if those old thinkers found
themselves floundering like babies just born in a
new world, do we imagine that all these generations
and these consummate intellects and elaborate in-
vestigations have not succeeded in making anything
clearer? Is it not the case that, just as in the
noblest of states Tiberius Gracchus arose to disturb
the atmosphere of peace, so when the most authori-
tative schools of philosophy had now come to a stand-
still, then there arose Arcesilas to overthrow the
established philosophy, and to lurk behind the
authority of those whom he asserted to have denicd
the possibility of all knowledge and perception?
From the list of these we must remove both Plato
and Socrates—the former because he left behind
him a most consummate system of thought, the
Peripatetic School and the Academy, which have
different names but agree in substance, and from
which the Stoics themselves disagreed more in ternis
