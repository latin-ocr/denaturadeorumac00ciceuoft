DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙΙ. xvi.

Bull, Lion, or of inanimate things such as the Argo,
41 the Altar, the Crown. But allowing these, how pray
can one possibly, I do not say allow, but make head
or tail of the remainder ? When we speak of corn as
Ceres and wine as Liber, we employ a familiar figure
of speech, but do you suppose that anybody can be
so insane as to believe that the food he eats is a god ?
As for the cases you allege of men who have risen to
the status of divinity, you shall explain, and I shall be
glad to learn, how this apotheosis was possible, or
why it has ceased to take place now. As at present
informed, I do not see how the hero to whose body

On Oeta's mount the torches were applied,

as Accius has it, can have passed from that burning
pyre to

The everlasting mansions of his Sire-,

in spite of the fact that Homer α represents Ulysses as
meeting him, among the rest of those who had de-

parted this life, in the world below 1
42 ‘⁴ Nevertheless I should like to know what par-
ticular Hercules it is that we worship3 for we are
told of several by the students of esoteric and re·
condite writings, the most ancient being the son of
Jupiter, that is of the most ancient Jupiter likewise,
for we find several J upiters also in the early writings
of the Greeks. That Jupiter then and Lysithoe were
the parents of the Hercules who is recorded to have
had a tussle with Apollo about a tripod! We hear
of another in Egypt, a son of the Nile, who is said to
have compiled the sacred books of Phrygia. A third
comes from the Digiti of Mount Ida, who offer sacri-
{pegks of Heracles as killed by the wrath of Hera, and of

e e as a virgin.
