DE NATURA DEORUM, I. xii.—-xiii.

are attributes essentia] to our conception of deity.
Yet both in the Timaeus and the Laws he says that
the world, the sky, the stars, the earth and our
souls are gods, in addition to those in whom
we have been taught to believe by ancestral
tradition3 but it is obvious that these propositions
are both inherently false and mutually destructive.
ιι Xenophon also commits almost the same errors,
though in fewer words3 for in his memoir⁰ of the
sayings of Socrates he represents Socrates as arguing
that it is wrong to inquire about the form of god,
but also as saying that both the sun and the soul are
god, and as speaking at one moment of a single god
and at another of several: utterances that involve
almost the same mistakes as do those which we
32 quoted from Plato. XIII. Antisthenes also, in his
book entitled The Natural Philosopher, says that while
there are many gods of popular belief, there is one
god in nature, so depriving divinity of all meaning
or substance. Very similarly Speusippus, following
his uncle Plato, and speaking of a certain force that
governs all things and is endowed with life, does his
best to root out the notion of deity from our minds
33 altogether. And Aristotle in the Third Book of his
Philosophy b has a great many confused notions, <not > ⁰
disagreeing with the doctrines of his master Plato;
at one moment he assigns divinity exclusively to the
intellect‚ at another he says that the world is itself a
god, then again he puts some other being over the
world, and assigns to this being the role of regulating
and sustaining the world-motion by means of a sort

those of Plato was made by Antiochus, and is often pro·
pounded by Cicero (Mayor); althou h it is true that it is
not appropriate to the Epicurean spea er here (Plasberg).
