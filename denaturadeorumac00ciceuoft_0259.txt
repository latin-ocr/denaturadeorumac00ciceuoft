DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xlii.—xliii.
which the Greeks

Engonasin call, as travelling “ on his knees.”
Here is the Crown, of radiance supreme.

This is in the rear of the Serpent, while at its head is
the Serpent-holder,

109 By Greeks called Ophiuchus, famous name ἰ
Firm between both his hands he “ holds the Snake‚'’
Himself in bondage by its body held,
For serpent round the waist engirdles man.
Yet treads he firm and presses all his weight‚
Trampling upon the Scorpion’s eyes and breast.

After the Septentriones comes

The Rem-ward, commonly Bootes called,
Because he drives the Bear yoked to a pole.

110 And then the following lines ε for with this Bootes

beneath his bosom fixed appears
A glittering star, Arcturus, famous name,

and below his feet moves

The Virgin bright, holding her ear of corn ⁵
Resplendent.

XLIII. And the constellations are so accurately

spaced out that their vast and ordered array clearly
displays the skill of a divine creator ε

By the Bear’s head you will descry the Twins,
Beneath its belly the Crab, and in its claws
The Lion’s bulk emits a twinkling ray.

The Charioteer

Hidden beneath the Twins’ left flank will glides
Him Helice confronts with aspect fierce:

At his left shoulder the bright She-goat stands.
[And then the following z]

A constellation vast and brilliant she,
Whereas the Kids emit a scanty light
Upon mankind.
