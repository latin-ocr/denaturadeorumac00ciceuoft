amare that the ορᾷεσίε of men ’s worship werefalse. For
after sayz'ng a number of things tending to subvert
religion, he adds nevertlzeless that these matters ought
not to be discussed in public, lest such discussion
destroy the established religion of the nation.

2. Ib. ii.8. 10. Cicero m discussing the nature os tle

therefore the carpenter when about to build a house
does not himself make timber but employs that which
has been prepared, and the same with the modeller
and his wax, so your divine providence ought to have
been supplied with matter not made by itself but
given to it ready-made. But if matter was not made
by god, earth, water, air and fire also were not made
b od.
