DE NATURA DEORUM, II. liii.-—-liv.

ences afforded by rivers, the ebb and flow ὁ . . . of the
tides of the sea, the mountains clothed with forests,
the salt-beds lying far inland from the sea-coast, the
copious stores of health-giving medicines that the
earth contains, and all the countless arts necessary
for livelihood and for life. Again the alternation of
day and night contributes to the preservation of
living creatures by affording one time for activity and
another for repose. Thus every line of reasoning goes
to prove that all things in this world of ours are mar-

for the safety and preservation of all.

this vast system contrived ? For the sake of the trees
and plants, for these, though without sensation, have
their sustenance from nature ? But this at any rate
is absurd. Then for the sake of the animals ? It is
no more likely that the gods took all this trouble for
the sake of dumb, irrational creatures. For whose
sake then shall one pronounce the world to have been
created ? Doubtless for the sake of those living
beings which have the use of reason ; these are the
gods and mankind, who assuredly surpass all other
things in excellence, since the most excellent of all
things is reason. Thus we are led to believe that the
world and all the things that it contains were made
for the sake of gods and men. -
