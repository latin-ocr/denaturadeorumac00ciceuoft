DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xliii.—xliv.

Beneath her feet

Crouches the hor-ned Ball, a mighty frame.
ll His head is bespangled with a multitude of stars t
The Greeks were wont to call them Hyades,

from their bringing rain, the Greek for which is ἠθείη,
while our nation stupidly names them the Sucking-
51ἕῖνὲῗᾶ Ἰὲἲὲᾎῑζῗ 3ῗέ1 ἓοῗὲἰῖῗῗ ζέἳζῗάῗέἶῧῖῗῗιῖἓ

Lesser Septentrio follows Cepheus, with open hands
outstretched ;

For close behind the Bear, the Cynosure‚⁰
He wheels,

Before him comes

Cassiepia with her darkling stars,

And next to her roams a bright shape, the sad
Andromeda, shunning ᾔει· mother's sight.

The belly of the Horse touches her head,

Proudly ᾔε tosses high his glittering mane ;

One common star holds their twin shapes conjoint
And constellations linked indissolubly.

Close by them stands the Ram with wreathed horns ε

and next to him

The Fishes gliding, one some space in front
And nearer to the North Wind's shuddering breath.

‚2 XLIV. At the feet of Andromeda Perseus is outlined‚

Assailed by all the zenith’s northern blasts ι
and by him
at his left knee placed on every side
The tiny Pleiads dim you will descry.

And, slightly sloping, next the Lyre is seen,
Next the winged Bird 'neath heaven’s wide eanopy.

Close to the Horse’s head is the right hand of
Aquarius, and then his whole figure.
