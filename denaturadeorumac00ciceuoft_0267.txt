DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xlv.—xlvi.

directions ; and thus while contiguous and conjoined
with the sea it has a natural tendency to rise to the
sky, and by receiving an admixture of the sky’s tenu-
ity and heat furnishes to living creatures the breath
of life and health. The air is enfolded by the highest
part of the sky, termed the ethereal part 3 this both
retains its own tenuous warmth uncongealed by any
admixture and unites with the outer surface of the
air. XLVI. In the aether the stars revolve in their
courses ; these maintain their spherical form by their
own internal gravitation, and also sustain their
motions by virtue of their very shape and conforma-
tion ; for they are round, and this is the shape, as I
believe Ι remarked before,‘² that is least capable of
118 receiving injury. But the stars are of a fiery sub-
stance, and for this reason they are nourished by the
vapours of the earth, the sea and the waters, which
are raised up by the sun out of the fields which it
warms and out of the waters 3 and when nourished
and renewed by these vapours the stars and the whole
aether shed them back again, and then once more
draw them up from the same source, with the loss of
none of their matter, or only of an extremely small
part which is consumed by the fire of the stars and
the flame of the aether. As a consequence of this, The cyclieal
so our school believe, though it used to be said that gssffiffieffiffl
Panaetius questioned the doctrine, there will ulti-
mately occur a conflagration of the whole world, be·
cause when the moisture has been used up neither
can the earth be nourished nor will the air continue
to flow, being unable to rise upward after it has drunk
up all the water 3 thus nothing will remain but fire,
by which, as 3 living being and a god, once again a
new world may be created and the ordered universe
