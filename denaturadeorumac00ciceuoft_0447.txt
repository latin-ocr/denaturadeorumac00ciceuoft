ACADEMICA, Ι. ἰί.

philosophy had been most carefully expounded in
Greek treatises, I judged that any persons from our
nation that felt an interest in the subject, if they were
learned in the teachings of the Greeks, would sooner
read Greek writings than ours, and if on the other
hand they shrank frorn the sciences and systems of
the Greeks, they would not care even for philo-
sophy, which cannot be understood without Greek
learning: and therefore I was unwilling to write
what the unlearned would not be able to understand
and the learned would not take the trouble to read.
6 But you are aware (for you have passed through the Logio
same course of study yourself) that we Academics
cannot be like Amafinius or Rabirius,‘² who discuss
matters that lie open to the view in ordinary language,
without employing any technicality and entirely dis-
pensing with definition and division and neat syllo-
gistic proof,¹' and who in fact believe that no science
of rhetoric or logio exists. But we for our part while
obeying the rules of the logicians and of the orators
also as if they were laws, for our school considers
each of these faculties a merit, are compelled to
employ novel terms as well, for which the learned, as
I said, will prefer to go to the Greeks, while the un-
learned will not accept them even from us, so that
6 all our toil will be undertaken in vain. Then as Pivsloe.
for natural philosophy, if I accepted the system of
Epicurus, that is of Democritus, I could write about
it as lucidly as Amafinius3 for when once you have
abolished causation, in the sense of efficient causes,

properly denoting an argument developed in a series of
questions, but also used for any form of proof, ἁπό-
δειξις. Concludere εσυλλογίζεσθαι, denoting logical inference,
and specially deduction.
