them 3 supply of 11631, without which their nurture
and growth would not be possible ; for everything of
a hot, fiery nature supplies its own source of motion
and activity ; but that which is nourished and grows
possesses a definite and uniform motion ; and as long
as this motion remains within us, so long sensation
and life remain, whereas so soon as our heat is cooled
and quenched we ourselves perish and are extin-

further arguments, to show how great is the supply of

food so heavy that it is not digested in twenty-four
hours ; and even the residue of our food which nature
rejects contains 11631. Again, the veins and arteries
never cease throbbing With a flame-like pulse, and
frequent cases have been observed when the 116311 of
an animal on being torn out of its body has continued
to beat with 3 rapid motion resembling 1116 flickering
of fire. Every living thing therefore, whether animal
or vegetable, owes its vitality to the 11631 contained
within it. From this it must be inferred that this
element of 11631 possesses in itself 3 vital force that
perv ades the whole world.
