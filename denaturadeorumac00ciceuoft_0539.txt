waver in their own ‘ decision ’ as they did in everything
else, particularly when it was the keystone of their
system, for this was the measuring-rod that applied
to the whole of philosophy, the test of truth and false-
hood, of knowledge and ignorance 3 and that since
they adopted this method, and desired to teach what
sense-presentations ought to be accepted and what
rejected, they unquestionably ought to have per-
ceived this decision itself, the basis of every criterion
of truth and falsehood ; for (he said) the two greatest
things in philosophy were the criterion of truth and
the end of goods, and no man could be a sage who
was ignorant of the existence of either a beginning of
the process of knowledge or an end of appetition, and
who consequently did not know from what he was
starting or at what he ought to arrive ; but to be in
doubt as to these matters and not to feel immovably
sure of them was to be very widely remote from wisdom.
On these lines therefore they ought to have been
required rather to say that this one thing at least
was perceivcd—the impossibility of perceiving any-
thing. But about the inconsistency of the whole of
their theory, if anybody holding no positive view at
all can be said to have any theory, enough, as I think,
may have been said.
