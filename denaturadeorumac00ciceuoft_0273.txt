DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xlviii—xlix.

weaves a kind of net, in order to dispatch anything
that is caught in it; another in order to . . .

a sort of partnership with the tiny shrimp to procure
food, and so, when little fishes swim into the gaping
shell, the shrimp draws the attention of the mussel
and the mussel shuts up its shells with a snap ‘² 3 thus
two very dissimilar creatures obtain their food in

their association is due to 3 sort of mutual compact, or
whether it was brought about by nature herself and
goes back to the moment of their birth. Our wonder
is also considerably excited by those aquatic animals
which are born on land—crocodiles, for instance, and
water-tortoises and certain snakes, which are born
on dry land but as soon as they can first crawl make

beneath hens, and the chicks that spring from the
eggs are at first fed and mothered by the hens that

their foster-mothers, and run away when they pursue
them, as soon as they have had an opportunity of

an instinct of sels-preservation has nature implanted
in living creatures. XLIX. I have even read in a

procures its food by flying after those birds which
dive in the sea, and upon their coming to the surface
