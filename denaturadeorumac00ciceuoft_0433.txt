INTRODUCTION TO ACADEMICA

expounded by Catulus; Hortensius countered with
the dogmatism of Antiochus (Old Academy), and
Cicero put the case of Philo (Middle Academy)‚
that ‘ probability ’ is consistent with Platonism. In
Book II.‚ Lucullus, Lucullus defended the cause
of Antiochus by attacking Scepticism, and then
Scepticism was defended by Cicero. In the second
edition Cicero and Varro were the sole interlocutors 3
Cicero championed the Middle Academy as well
as the New, and the Old Academy was assigned to
Varro.

It is to this second edition that Cicero refers in his
letters in all allusions to the work after the alteration
was made 3 its title was now Academica, though he
also describes it as ‘ Academici libri.’ But he seems
not to have succeeded in entirely suppressing the
first edition3 and by a curious accident the second
half of the first edition has come down to us, while
of the second edition only the first quarter and a few
fragments of the remainder have survived. We
therefore have only three quarters of the whole work,
and only one quarter of it in the form finally author-
ized by the writer. Some modern editors have
designated the extant part of Edition I. ‘ Academica
Priora ' and that of Edition ΙΙ. ‘ Academica
Posteriora‚’ but so far as I know the significance
intended to be conveyed by the adjectives in those
titles has no classical authority.

The position can be most clearly exhibited in
tabular form ; the parts of the editions that are not
now extant and the names of the speakers in those
parts are printed in italics :
