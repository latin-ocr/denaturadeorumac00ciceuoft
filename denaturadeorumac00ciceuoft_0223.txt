DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xxviii.

engage in wars and battles, and that not only when
as in Homer two armies are contending and the gods
take sides and intervene on their behalf‚ but they
actually fought wars of their own, for instance with
the Titans and with the Giants. These stories and
these beliefs are utterly foolish; they are stuffed
u with nonsense and absurdity of all sorts. But though Tale·
repudiating these myths with contempt, we shall re¹¹⁸¹⁰²
nevertheless be able to understand the personality
and the nature of the divinities pervading the sub-
stance of the several elements, Ceres permeating
earth, Neptune the sea, and so on 3 and it is our duty
to revere and worship these gods under the names
which custom has bestowed upon them. But the best
and also the purest‚ holiest and most pious way of
worshipping the gods is ever to venerate them with
purity, sincerity and innocence both of thought and
of speech. For religion has been distinguished from
superstition not only by philosophers but by our
[2 aneestors. Persons who spent whole days in prayer
and sacrifice to ensure that their children should out-
live them were termed ‘ superstitious ’ (from superstes,
a survivor)‚ and the word later acquired a wider appli-
cation. Those on the other hand who carefully re-
viewed and so to speak retraced all the lore of ritual
were called ‘religious ' from relegere (to retrace or
re-read), like ‘ elegant ’ from eligere (to select), ‘ dih·-
gent ' from diligere (to care for), ‘ intelligent ’ from
intellegere (to understand) ; for all these words con-
tain the same sense of ‘ picking out ' (legere) that
is present in ‘ religiouS.' ⁰ Hence ‘ superstitious ' and
‘ religious ' came to be terms of censure and approval
respectively. I think that I have said enough to
prove the existence of the gods and their nature.
