ACADEMICA, II. (Lucanus), xvi.

If you reach this conclusion owing to my yielding to
you each successive step, the fault will have been
mine ; but if you get there of your own accord, it
60 will be yours. For who will have granted you either
that the deity is omnipotent, or that even if he can
do as described he will? and how do you make such
assumptions that, if it is possible for „r to resemble
y, it will follow that only with difficulty can x and y
be known apart? and then, that they cannot even
be known apart ? and finally, that they are identical ?
for example, if wolves are like dogs, you will end by
saying that they are identical. And it is a fact that
some honourable things are like dishonourable ones
and some good things like not good ones and some
artistic things like inartistic ones ; why do we hesi-
tate therefore to aver that there is no difference
between these? Have we no eye even for incon-
gruities ? for there is nothing that cannot be carried
over from its own class into another class. But if it
were proved that there is no difference between
presentations of different classes, we should find pre-
sentations that belonged both to their own class and
to one foreign to them 3 how can this possibly occur ?
51 Consequently there is only one way of routing the
difficulty about unreal presentations, whether de-
picted by the imagination, which we admit frequently
to take place, or in slumber or under the influence of
wine or of insanity : we shall declare that all pre-
sentations of this nature are devoid of perspicuity,
to which we are bound to cling tooth and nail. For
who when feigning to himself an imaginary picture
of some object, the moment he bestirs himself and
recalls his sels-consciousness does not at once per-
ceive the difference between perspicuous presentations
