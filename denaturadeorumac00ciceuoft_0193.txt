also causes all things to flourish and to bring forth
increase each after its kind. Hence since the sun
resembles those fires which are contained in the bodies
of living creatures, the sun also must be alive 3 and
so too the other heavenly bodies, since they have
their origin in the fiery heat of heaven that is entitled
-2 the aether or sky. Since therefore some livino·

creatures are born on the earth, others in the wateer>¹ {ffeffiffissffi

and others in the air, it is absurd, so Aristotle ‘² holds, ζέξξζξΐ
to suppose that no living animal is born in that probably
element which is most adapted for the generation ἷὲἔῗιῗεῖῃθ
of living things. But the stars occupy the region of intellect3
aether, and as this has a very rarefied substance and
is always in lively motion, it follows that the animal
born in this region has the keenest senses and the
swiftest power of movement3 hence since the stars
corne into existence in the aether, it is reasonable to
suppose that they possess sensation and intelligence.
And from this it follows that the stars are to be
reckoned as gods, XVI. For it may be observed that
the inhabitants of those countries in which the air is
pure and rarefied have keener'wits and greater powers
of understanding than persons who live in a dense and

{3 heavy climate 3 moreover the substance employed as
food is also believed to have some influence on mental
acuteness 3 it is therefore likely that the stars possess
surpassing intelligence, since they inhabit the ethereal
region of the world and also are nourished by the
moist vapours of sea and earth, rarefied in their ifftgffioenco
passage through the wide intervening space. Again, 9f theZtars
