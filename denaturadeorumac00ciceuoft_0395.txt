bequeath legacies in the hope of {estowing them
beneficially‚ a hope in which we may be deceived;
but how could god be deceived? As the Sun was,
when he gave his son Pha‘e‘thon a ride in his chariot ?
or Neptune, when his bestowal on his son of permis-
sion for three wishes resulted in Theseus’ causing the
77 death of Hippolytus ‘² ? These are fables of the poets,
whereas we aim at being philosophers, who set down
facts, not fictions. And all the same, even these gods
of poetry would be held guilty of mistaken kindness
if they knew that their gifts would bring their sons
disaster. Just as, if a favourite saying of Aristo of
Chios was true, that philosophers are harmful to
their hearers when the hearers put a bad interpreta-
tion on doctrines good in themselves (for he allowed
it was possible to leave the school of Aristippus a
profligate, or that of Zeno cantankerous), then
clearly, if their pupils were likely to go away de·
praved because they misinterpreted the philosophers’
discourses, it would be better for the philosophers
to keep silence than to do harm to those who heard
78 them ε similarly, if men abuse the faculty of reason,
bestowed on them with a good intention by the im-
mortal godS, by employing it to cheat and wrong
their fellows, it would have been better for it not
to be bestowed upon the human race than to be
bestowed. Just as, supposing a doctor to know that a
patient for whom he prescribes wine will be certain
to drink it with too little water and will die on the
spot, that doctor would be greatly to blame, so your
Stoic providence is to be censured for bestowing
reason upon those whom it knew to be going to use
