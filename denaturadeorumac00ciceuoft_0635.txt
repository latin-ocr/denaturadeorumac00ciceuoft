the formula ⁴ the wise man withholds assent ' is used
in two ways, one when the meaning is that he gives
absolute assent to no presentation at all, the other
when he restrains himself from replying so as to
convey approval or disapproval of something, with the
consequence that he neither makes a negation nor an
affirmation 3 and that this being so, he holds the one
plan in theory, so that he never assents, but the
other in practice, so that he is guided by probability,
and wherever this confronts him or is wanting he
can answer ‘ yes ' or ‘ no ’ accordingly. In fact as we
hold that he who restrains himself from assent about
all things nevertheless does move and does act, the
view is that there remain presentations of a sort that
arouse us to action, and also answers that we can
give in the affirmative or the negative in reply to
questions, merely following a corresponding presenta-
tion, provided that we answer without actual assent ;
but that nevertheless not all presentations of this
character were actually approved, but those that
nothing hindered.

they may no doubt be false, but certainly they are
not detestable. For we don't rob you of daylight,

and ‘grasped,’ we describe the same things (pro-

vided they are probable) as ‘ appearing.' (7)Rep1y to
