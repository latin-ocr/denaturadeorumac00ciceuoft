DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xxxii—xxxiii.

ago 3 let us look at more recent cases. Why is my
uncle Publius Rutilius, a man of stainless honour and
also of consummate learning, now in exile ? why
was my comrade Drusus murdered in his own home ?
why was that pattern of high principle and of wisdom,
the chief pontiff Quintus Scaevola, assassinated in
front of the statue of Vesta? why before that were
so many leading citizens also made away with by
Cinna? why had that monster of treachery Gaius
Marius the power to order the death of 'that noblest
81 of mankind, Quintus Catulus? The day would be
too short if I desired to recount the good men visited
by misfortune; and equally so were I to mention
the wicked who have prospered exceedingly. For
why did Marius die so happily in his own home, an
old man and consul for the seventh time ? why did
that monster of cruelty Cinna lord it for so long?
You will say that he was punished. XXXIII. It
would have been better for him to be hindered and
prevented from murdering so many eminent men,
than finally to be punished in his turn. That bar-

the most painful torture: if this was for stabbing
Drusus and poisoning Metellus, it would have been
better for their lives to be preserved than for Varius
to be punished for his crime. Dionysius ¹was despot
of a most wealthy and prosperous city for thirty-eight
82 years3 and before him, for how many years was
Pisistratus tyrant of Athens, the very flower of Greece l
⁴ Ah but Phalaris (you say) met with punishment, and
so did Apollodorus.' Yes, but not till after they had
tortured and killed many victims. Many brigands
too are frequently punished, but still we cannot say
that the captives cruelly murdered do not outnumber
