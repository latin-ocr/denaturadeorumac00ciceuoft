DE NATURA DEORUM, 11. ix.—x.

in the caverns of the earth, which in winter is denser
and therefore confines more closely the heat stored
26 in the soil. X. It would require a long discourse and
a great many arguments to enable me to show that
all the seeds that earth receives in her womb, and all
the plants which she spontaneously generatos and
holds fixed by their roots in the ground, owe both
their origin and growth to this warni temperature of
the soil. That water also contains an admixture of
heat is shown first of all by its liquid nature 3 water
would neither be frozen into ice by cold nor congealed
into snow and hoar-frost unless it could also become
fluid when liquefied and thawed by the admixture
of heat3 this is why moisture both hardens when
exposed to a north wind or a frost from some other
quarter, and also in turn softens when warmed, and
evaporates with heat. Also the sea when violently
stirred by the wind becomes warm, so that it can
readily be realized that this great body of fluid con-
tains heat3 for we must not suppose the warnith in
question to be derived from some external source, but
stirred up from the lowest depths of the sea by violent
motion, just as happens to our bodies when they are
restored to warmth by movement and exercise. In-
deed the air itself, though by nature the coldest of
the elements, is by no means entirely devoid of heat ;
27 indeed it contains even a considerable admixture of
heat, for it is itself generated by exhalation from
water, since air must be deemed to be a sort of
vaporized water, and this vaporization is caused by
the motion of the heat contained in the water. We
may see an example of the same process when water
is made to boil by placing fire beneath it.—-There
remains the fourth element ε this is itself by nature
