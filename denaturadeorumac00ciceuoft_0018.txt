INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

is then laid and the characters introduced. The
theology of Epicurus is taken first. It is expounded
by Velleius (Q 18-56), who precedes his exposition by
a preliminary attack on the theology and cosmogony
of Plato and the Stoics, and a refutation (Q 25-41) of
the theology of the other schools from Thales down-
ward. He is answered (Q 57 to end) by the Academic
Cotta, who demolishes the Epicurean theology, and
pronounces Epicureanism to be really fatal to religion

( In Book ii. the Stoic theology is set out by Balbus,
who proves (1) the divine existence (Q 4-44), and ex-
pounds (2) the divine nature (Q 45-72), (3) the provi-
dential government of the world (Q 73-153), and (4)
the care of providence for man (Q 154 to end). Cotta
again replies, in Book iii.‚ giving the Academic criti-
cism of the Stoic theology under the same four heads:
(1) Q 7-19, (2) Q 20-64‚ (3) ἓ 65 (the rest of this division
is lost), (4) Q 66 to end.

DRAMATIS hamma—Thus although as it stands
the dialogue is one continuous conversation with the
same persons present throughout, it falls into two
separate parts, in which two different speakers take
the lead ; but the rejoinder in both cases is made by
Cotta. Velleius the Epicurean speaker and Balbus
the Stoic are only known to us from this book, except
that De Oratore (iii. 78) gives Velleius as a friend of
the orator L. Licinius Crassus, and mentions ‘ duo
Balbi ' among the Stoics of the day. Both spokes-
men, and also Cotta the Academic, are spoken of here
as leaders in their schools (i. 16). Cotta had already
been commended to Cicero by Atticus (Att. xiii. 19. 3),
and had been mentioned by Cicero before in De Ora-
tore (iii.145) as having joined the Academy ; Cicero
