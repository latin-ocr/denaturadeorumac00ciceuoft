done SO, and no eloquence of anybody, learned or
unlearned, shall ever dislodge me from the belief as
to the worship of the immortal gods which I have
inherited from our forefathers. But on any question
of religion I am guided by the high pontiffs, Titus

comprises ritual, auspices, and the third additional
division consisting of all such prophetie warnings as
the interpreter-s of the Sybil or the soothsayers have
derived from portents and prodigies. well, I have
always thought that none of these departments of
religion was to be despised, and Ι have held the con-
viction that Romulus by his auspices and Numa by
his establishment of our ritual laid the foundations of
our state, which assuredly could never have been as
great as it is had not the fullest measure of divine

letting me know yours. You are a philosopher, and
Ι ought to receive from you a proof of your religion,
whereas I must believe the word of our ancestors even
without proof.''

and lastly, that they care for the welfare of men.
