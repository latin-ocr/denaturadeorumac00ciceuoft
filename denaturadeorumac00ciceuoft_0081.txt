DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xix.--xx.

virtue, and knows with absolute certainty that he ottho atoms
will always enjoy pleasures at once consummate and ζζὲὴξοζοέξ
52 everlasting. XX. This is the god whom we should fate·
call happy in the proper sense of the term; your
Stoic god seems to us to be grievously overworked.
If the world itself is god, what can be less restful than
to revolve at incredible speed round the axis of the
heavens without a single moment of respite? but
repose is an essential condition of happiness. If on
the other hand some god resides within the world as
its governor and pilot, maintaining the courses of the
stars, the changes of the seasons and all the ordered
process of creation‚ and keeping a watch on land and
sea to guard the interests and lives of men, why, what
a bondage of irksome and laborious business is his Ξ
53 We for our part deem happiness to consist in tran-
quillity of mind and entire exemption from all duties.
For he who taught us all the rest has also taught us
that the world was made by nature, without needing
an artificer to construet it, and that the act of crea-
tion, which according to you cannot be performed
without divine skill, is so easy, that nature will
create, is creating and has created worlds without
number. You on the contrary cannot see how nature
can achieve all this without the aid of some intelli-
gence, and so, like the tragic poets, being unable to
bring the plot of your drama to a de'nouement, you
54 have recourse to a god⁰; whose intervention you
assuredly would not require if you would but con·
template the measureless and boundless extent of
space that stretches in every direction‚ into which
when the mind proj ects and propels itself, it journeys
onward far and wide without ever sighting any
margin or ultimate point where it can stop. Well
