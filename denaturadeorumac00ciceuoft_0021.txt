INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

the whole ; there are Stoic touches throughout (ἓ 80
1110 jest at the Academy, ἓ 95 the divinity of the
universe, ἓ 100 the teleological argument, ἓ 103
beasts born in fire, ξ 110 virtue as an active prin-
ciple, §5 115 the definitions of piety and holiness,
ἓ 121 the union of man and God). But the Stoic
origin of the. passage is disputed by some authorities,
and it has indeed an Academic colouring: it may
possibly come, like Book 111., from Clitomachus, the
editor of Carneades, though Carneades is nowhere
quoted here as he is in Book iii.

For the Stoic system in Book ii. Cicero probably
follows Posidonius. He was unlike most of his school
(1) in having literary tastes, and using an easy style
with historical illustrations, (2) in being interested in
science, and (3) in admiring Plato and Aristotle and
adapting Stoicism to suit their doctrines. Tbese
features are seen in Cicero’s exposition: (1) poetic
quotations occur in §g 4, 65, 89, 104-114, 159, and his-
torical illustrations in §g 6-11 , 61, 69, 165 ; (2) ἓ 88 refers
to the orrery of Posidonius and to astronomica] de-
tails, tides, the ether, volcanoes‚ climate, human diet,
the kinship of plant, animal, and human life (an Aris·
totelian touch, conflicting with the older Stoicism),
the eternity of the rational soul (which with the early
Stoics perished in the universal Conflagration)‚ the
origin of civilization (a rationalization of the myth of
the Golden Age) ; (3) Plato is ‘ the god of philosophers ’
ἓ 32, and Aristotle is praised {g 95, 125, and many
details are borrowed from him.

Τ110 source of the Academic criticism of Stoic theo·-
logy which occupies Book iii. is certainly Hasdrubal
of Carthage‚ better known under his Greek name of
Clitomachus. He was born c. 180 B.c. and went to
