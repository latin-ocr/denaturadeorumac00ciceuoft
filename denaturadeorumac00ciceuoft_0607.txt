as a false presentation3 the second, that a false pre-
sentation cannot be perceived ; the third, that of pre-
sentations between which there is no difference it is
impossible for some to be able to be perceived and
others not; the fourth, that there is no true pre-
sentation originating from sensation with which there
is not ranged another presentation that precisely
corresponds to it and that cannot be perceived.⁰ The
second and third of these four arguments are admitted
by everybody 3 the first is not granted by Epicurus,
but you with whom we are dealing admit that one

too ; the entire battle is about the fourth. If there· i

fore a person looking at Publius Servilius Geminus b
used to think he saw Quintus, he was encountering
a presentation of a sort that could not be perceived‚
because there was no mark to distinguish a true pre-
sentation from a false one ; and if that mode of dis-
tinguishing were removed, what mark would he have,
of such a sort that it could not be false, to help him
to recognize Gaius Cotta, who was twice consul with
Geminus? You say that so great a degree of resem-
blance does not exist in the world You show fight,
no doubt, but you have an easy- going opponent3 let
us grant by all means that it does not exist, but un-
doubtedly it can appear to exist, and therefore it will
cheat the sense, and if a single case of resemblance
has done that, it will have made everything doubtful ;
for when that proper canon of recognition has been
removed, even if the man himself whom you see
is the man he appears to you to be, nevertheless
you will not make that judgement, as you say it
ought to be made, by means of a mark of such a sort
that a false likeness could not have the same char-
acter. Tberefore seeing that it is possible for Publius
