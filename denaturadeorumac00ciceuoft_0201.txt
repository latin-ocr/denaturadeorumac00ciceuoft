bodieS,⁰ some that travel from east to west in un- (2),'1'h0
changing paths, without ever making the slightest ἓὲζῖἷῖἧγῑ,
deviation in their course, while the others perform {rfi’gssitgquq
two unbroken revolutions in the same paths and shown {13'
courses. Now both of these facts indicate at once the Qffezaffm
rotatory motion of the firmament, which is only
possible with a spherical shape, and the circular
revolutions of the heavenly bodies.
“ Take first of all the sun, which is the chief of the the sun,

celestial bodies. Its motion is such that it first fills
the countries of the earth with a flood of light, and
then leaves them in darkness now on one side and
now on the other ; for night is caused merely by the
shadow of the earth, which intercepts the light of
the sun. Its daily and nightly paths have the same
regularity. Also the sun by at one time slightly
approaching and at another time slightly receding
causes a moderate variation of temperature. For
the passage of about 365} diurnal revolutions of the
sun completes the circuit of a year 3 and by bending
its course now towards the north and now towards
the south the sun causes summers and winters and
the two seasons of which one follows the waning of
winter and the other that of summer. Thus from the
changes of the four seasons are derived the origins
and causes of all those creatures which come into
existence on land and in the sea.

the yearly course of the sun ; and her light wanes to
its minimum when she approaches nearest to the sun,
and waxes to its maximum each time that she recedes
farthest from him. And not only is her shape and
outline altered by her alternate waxing and waning

or returning to her starting-point‚ but also her posi-
