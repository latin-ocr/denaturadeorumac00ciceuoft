DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxix.—-xxx.

73 XXIX. ‘⁸ Next I have to show that the world is 11. Pm-
governed by divine providence. This is of course a ἔζῇξῗῐξζῇζῃῐ
vast topic; the doctrine is hotly contested by your 01' the *forld
school, Cotta, and it is they no doubt that are my Ῑέἒῃῖἓῖω)
chief adversaries here. As for you and your friends, {uqtssl'frygn
Velleius, you scarcely understand the vocabulary of snffgrss {re

the subject ; for you only read your own writings, and {gggcilegle-in
are so enamoured of them that you pass judgement

universe. But as a matter of fact ‘ providence ' is an

state is ruled by the council,’ the words ‘ of the
Areopagus ' are omitted : so when we speak of the
world as governed by providence, you must under-

the full and complete statement would be ‘ the world
is governed by the providence of the gods.' So do not
you and your friends waste your wit on making fun
of us,—your tribe is none too well off for that com-
modjty. Indeed if your school would take my advice
you would give up all attempts at humour 3 it sits ill
upon you, for it is not your forte and you can't bring
it off. This does not, it is true, apply to you in par-
ticular,—you have the polished manners of your family
and the urbanity of a Roman 3 but it does apply to
all the rest of you, and especially to the parent of the
system, an uncultivated, illiterate person, who tilts
at everybody and is entirely devoid of penetration,
