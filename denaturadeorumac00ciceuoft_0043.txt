DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. ν.-νί.

to, that of a purely negative dialectic which refrains
from pronouncing any positive judgement. This,
after being originated by Socrates, revived by
Arcesilas, and reinforced by Carneades, has flourished
right down to our own period ; though Ι understand
that in Greece itself it is now almost bereft of ad-
herents. But this I ascribe not to the fault of the
Academy but to the dullness of mankind. If it is a
considerable matter to understand any one of the
systems of philosophy singly‚ how much harder is it to
master them all ἔ Yet this is the task that confronts
those whose principle is to discover the truth by the
method of arguing both for and against all the schOOIS.

12 In an undertaking so extensive and so arduous, Ι do
not profess to have attained success, though I do
claim to have attempted it. At the same time
it would be impossible for the adherents of this
method to dispense altogether with any standard of
guidance. This matter it is true I have discussed
elsewhere more thoroughly3 but some people are
so dull and slow of apprehension that they appear
to require repeated explanations. Our position is
not that we hold that nothing is true, but that we
assert that all true sensations are associated with
false ones so closely resembling them that they
contain no infallible mark to guide our judgement
and assent.‘² From this followed the corollary, that
many sensations are probable, that is, though not
amounting to a full perception they are yet possessed
of a certain distinctness and clearness, and so can
serve to direct the conduct of the wise man.
