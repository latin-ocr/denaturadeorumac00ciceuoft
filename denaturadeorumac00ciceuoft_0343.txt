hardened by work); well, Chrysippus argues thus :
⁸ If anything exists that man is not capable of creat-
ing, he that creates that thing is superior to man3
but man is not capable of creating the obj ects that we
see in the world 3 therefore he that was capable of so
doing surpasses man3 but who could surpass man
save god? therefore god exists.' The whole of this
is involved in the same mistake as the argument of
26 Zeno ; no definition is given of the meaning of
‘ superior ’ and ‘ more excellent,' or of the distinction
between nature and reason. Chrysippus furthermore
declares that, if there be no gods, the natural universe
contains nothing superior to man ; but for any man to
think that there is nothing superior to man he deems
to be the height of arrogance. Let us grant that it is
a mark of arrogance to value oneself more highly than
the world ; but not merely is it not a mark of arro-
gance, rather is it a mark of wisdom, to realize that
one is a conscious and rational being, and that Orion
and Canicula are not. Again, he says ‘ If we saw a
handsome mansion, we should infer that it was built
for its masters and not for mice3 so therefore we
must deem the world to be the mansion of the gods.’
