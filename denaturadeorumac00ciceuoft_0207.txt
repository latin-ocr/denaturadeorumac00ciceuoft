DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xxi.—xxii.

recur daily with exact regularity. It is not the case
that they are carried along by the aether or that their
courses are fixed in the firmament, as most people
ignorant of natural philosophy aver3 for the aether
is not of such a nature as to hold the stars and cause
them to revolve by its own force, since being rare and
translucent and of uniform diffused heat, the aether
does not appear to be well adapted to contain the
stars. Therefore the fixed stars have a sphere of
their own, separate from and not attached to the
aether. Now the continual and unceasing revolutions
of these stars, marvellously and incredibly regular as
they are, clearly show that these are endowcd with
divine power and intelligence ; so that anyone who
cannot perceive that they themselves possess divinity
would seem to be incapable of understanding any·
thing at all.

‘⁴ In the heavens therefore there is nothing of
chance or hazard, no error, no frustration, but
absolute order, accuracy, calculation and regularity.
Whatever lacks these qualities‚ whatever is false and
spurious and full of error, belongs to the region be-
tween the earth and the moon (the last of all the
heavenly bodies), and to the surface of the earth.
Anyone therefore who thinks that the marvellous
order and incredible regularity of the heavenly
bodieS, which is the sole source of preservation and
safety for all things, is not rational, himself cannot
be deemed a rational being.

“ I therefore belleve that I shall not be wrong if
in discussing this subject I take my first principle
from the prince of seekers after truth, Zeno himself.
