INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

Athens about the age of twenty-five, becoming the
pupil of Carneades and succeeding him as head of
the Academy. He left voluminous records of the
doctrines of his master, who left none. Carneades
was the great source of all criticism of the StoicS‚
especially of their theology : he ‘ was fond of tilting
at the Stoics,' N.D. ii. 162. The proof os the mor-
tality of all animal life, N .D. iii. 29-34, and the sorites,
ἐξ 43-52, are explicitly taken from Carneades.

MSS—There are many MSS. of Cicero containing
De Natura Deorum, but few are old and none earlier
than the ninth century. All go back to one arche-
type, as is proved by errors, gaps, and transpositions
common to all ; but none seems to have been copied
directly from it, and there appear to have been two
lines of tradition from it, exemplified by two of
the oldest mss„ which must be deemed the most im-
portant ; both belonged to Voss and are at Leyden—
A dating at the end of the ninth or beginning of the
tenth century, and B a little later. They have many
errors and some considerable gaps in common, but
differ in many readings and transpositions. The other
superior mss. all group with A, viz. V (the Palatine, at
Vienna, almost of the same date), N (Bibliotheque
N ationale, Paris, twelfth century, descended from V),
O (Bodleian, end of twelfth century) ; and so do all
the inferior copies.

The present edition merely notes at the foot of the
page a few of the variants of A and B and of the
other mss. (grouped together as deteriores) in places
where the true reading seems doubtful.
