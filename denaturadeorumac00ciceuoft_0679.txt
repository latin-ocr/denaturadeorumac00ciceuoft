ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (LUCULLus), xliv.—-xlv.

136 sider on another occasion.‘² How indeed that ferocity
of yours forced an entrance into the Old Academy
I do not know, · but Ι cannot approve b those doctrines,
not because they seem unsatisfactory to me (for most
of the‘ surprising arguments, 'the so- -called paradoxa

Scipio and Marcus Marcellus,—-he was a colleague of
your grandfather, Lucullus, as consul, and his own
history written in Greek shows him to have been a
decidedly learned man,—said to Carneades in jest:

[because I am not a wise man ⁰¹]‚ nor is this a real
