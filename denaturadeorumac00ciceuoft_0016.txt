INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

elsewhere he rates his work rather higher: ‘ As my
habit is, I shall draw from the fountains of the Greeks
at my own judgement and discretiori ' (Qff. i. 6), and
‘I do not merely perform the office of a translator,
but apply my own judgement and my own arrange-
ment ' (F in. 1. 6). His method was unambitious t he
took some recent handbook of one or other of the
leading schools of philosophy and reproduced it in
Latin ; but he set passages of continuous exposition
in a frame of dialogue, and he added illustrations from
Roman history and poetry. His obj eet was to popu-

N.D. : Dur: OF COMPOSITION.—In the preface to
De Divinatione, book ii„ Cicero gives an account of his
philosophical authorship. We read there (ἓ 3) that
he finished his three books De Natura Deorum after he
had published Tusculan Disputations 3 and that then,
to complete his treatment of the subject, he began
De Divinatione, intending to add a treatise De Fato.
The preface quoted was vnitten soon after Caesar's
death, but the work itself before it (id. §7), as was
De Natura Deorum (see i. 4). Cicero's letter to Atticus
dated the Ides of June in 45 13.c. (Att. xiii. 8) shows
