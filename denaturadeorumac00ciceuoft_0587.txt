the dignity of the wise man than error, frivolity or
rashness. What then shall I say about the wise
man 's firmness ? even you Lucullus, allow that he
never advances a mere opinion. And since you
agree with this (to deal with you out of turn. · I will
soon return to a regular procedure), consider first

steep slope. But if on the contraryI assume on my
own authority that there is nothing at all that can be
