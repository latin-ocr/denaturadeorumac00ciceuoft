INTRODUCTION TO ACADEMICA

supporter of Sulla, and was famous as the conqueror
of Mithridates. He was superseded in his command
by Pompey in 66, and gradually withdrew from public
life. He had amassed great wealth on his Asiatic
campaigns, and was famous for the splendour of his
establishments. He had literary tastes and was a
generous patron of letters.

Q. Hortensius (114-50 Bc) made a career and a
fortune by his oratorical ability. An adherent of Sulla
and the aristocratic party, he was consul in 69 ; but
in the previous year the trial of Verres for peculation
in Sicily had transferred the primacy in oratory from
Verres’ defender‚ Hortensius, to his prosecutor,
Cicero. Hortensius was an opponent of Pompey,
and on Pompey’s coalition with Crassus and Caesar
in 60 he retired from politics.

M. Terentius Varro (116—28 Rc.) was the most
learned of scholars and the most encyclopaedic of
writers. His works included agriculture, grammar,
religious and political antiquities, biography, philo-
sophy, geography and law; some parts of his books
on the first two subj ects alone survive. He also had
a public career3 he held naval command against the
pirates and against Mithridates, and he supported
Pompey in the civil war, but after Pharsalia Caesar
forgave him, and employed his talents in collecting
books for a great public library.

THE IMAGINARY DATE of the dialogues in the first
edition falls between 63 B.c., the year of Cicero's
consulship (alluded to Ac. ii. 62), and 60, when
Catulus died. The scene of the first conversation
(now lost) was the sea-side villa of Catulus at Cumae,
west of N aples ; that of the second (our Academica IL),
a day later, is Hortensius’s villa at Bauli, a little
