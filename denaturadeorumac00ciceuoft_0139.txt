DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xl.

not arise from and come back to the body. 1 don't
suppose that you, Velleius, are like the rest of the
Epicureans, who are ashamed of certain utterances
of Epicurus, in which he protests that he cannot con-
ceive any good that is unconnected with the pleasures
of the voluptuary and the sensualist‚ pleasures which
in fact he proceeds without a blush to enumerate by
12 name. Well then, what viands and beverages, what
harmonies of music and flowers of various hue, what
delights of touch and smell will you assign to the gods,
so as to keep them steeped in pleasure ? The poets
array banquets of nectar and ambrosia, with Hebe or
Ganymede in attendance as cup-bearer3 but what
will you do, Epicurean? I don't see either where
your god is to procure these delights or how he is to
enjoy them. It appears then that mankind is more
bountifully equipped for happiness than is the deity,
since man can experience a wider range of pleasures.
13 You tell me that you consider these pleasures in-
ferior, which merely ‘tickle' the senses (the expression
is that of Epicurus α). When will you cease jesting ?
Why, even our friend Philo was impatient with the
Epicureans for affecting to despise the pleasures of
sensual indulgence ; for he had an excellent memory
and could quote verbatim a number of maxims from
the actual writings of Epicurus. As for Metro·
dorus, Epicurus’s co-partner in philosophy, he sup-
plied him with many still more outspoken quotations 3
in fact Metrodorus takes his brother Timocrates to
task for hesitating to measure every element of happi-
ness by the standard of the belly, nor is this an
isolated utterance, but he repeats it several times.
I see you nod your assent, as you are acquainted with
the passages ; and did you deny it, I would produce
