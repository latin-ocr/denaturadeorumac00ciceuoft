DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xxxiv.

Silus and the rest, but Socrates himself, the father
of philosophy, he declared to have been the Attio
equivalent of our Roman buffoons; and he always

*4 alluded to Chrysippus in the feminine gender. You
yourself just now, when reeling off the list of philo-
sophers like the censor calling the roll of the Senate‚
said that all those eminent men were fools, idiots and
madmen. But if none of these discerned the truth
about the divine nature, it is to be feared that the
divine nature is entirely non-existent.

‘⁴ For as for your school's account of the matter,
it is the merest fairy-story‚ hardly worthy of old wives
at work by lamplight. You don't perceive what a
number of things you are let in for, if we consent to
admit that men and gods have the same form. You
will have to assign to god exactly the same physic-al
exercises and care of the person as are proper to men z
he will walk, run, recline, bend, sit, hold things in the
hand, and lastly even converse and make speeches.

³5 As for your saying that the gods are male and female,
well, you must see what the consequence of that m‘ll
be. For my part, I am at a loss to imagine how your
great founder arrived at such notions. All the same
you never cease vociferating that we must on no
account relinquish the divine happiness and immor-
tality. But what prevents god from being happy
without having two legs ? and why cannot your
⁸ beatitude ' or ‘ beatity,’ whichever form we are to
use—and either is certainly a hard mouthful, but
words have to be sostened by use—but whatever it
is, why can it not apply to the sun yonder, or to this
world of ours, or to some eternal intelligence devoid
>6 of bodily shape and members? Your only answer
is, ⁸ I have never seen a happy sun or world.' well,
