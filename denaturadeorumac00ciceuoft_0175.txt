DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. viii.—ix.

which has not the faculty of reason ; but nothing is
superior to the world; therefore the world has the
faculty of reason.' A similar argument can be used
to prove that the world is wise, and happy, and
eternal ; for things possessed of each of these attri-
butes are superior to things devoid of them, and
nothing is superior to the world. From this it will
follow that the world is god. Zeno also argued thus z

32 ‘ Nothing devoid of sensation can have a part of itself
that is sentient3 but the world has parts that are
sentient 3 therefore the world is not devoid of
sensation.' He also proceeds to press the argument
more closely ε ⁴ Nothing‚' he says, ⁶ that is inanimate
and irrational can give birth to an animate and
rational being ; but the world gives birth to animate
and rational beings 3 therefore the world is animate
and rational.’ Furthermore he proved his argument
by means of one of his favourite comparisons‚ as
follows ε ‘ If flutes playing musical tunes grew on an
olive-tree‚ surely you would not question that the
olive-tree possessed some knowledge of the art of
flute-playing ; or if plane-trees bore well-tuned lutes,
doubtless you would likewise infer that the plane-
trees possessed the art of music 3 why then should we
not judge the world to be animate and endowed with
wisdom, when it produces animate and wise offspring?'

in a different way from that which Ι proposed at the ffssssffcgrf'm
beginning (for I said that this part required no dis-
cussion, since the existence of god was manifest to beatis th„
everybody), in spite of this I should like to prove even ffigtsigfffand
this point by means of arguments drawn from Physics light '
