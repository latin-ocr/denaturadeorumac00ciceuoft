sun cannot be perceived ; therefore he that accepts
it as if he perceived it, perceives nothing. Suppose
their answer is that it can be perceived how large the

was followed by Parmenides and Zeno (and so the
school of thought derived from them the name of
Eleatic) and afterwards by Euclides, the pupil of
Socrates, a Megarian (from whom the same school
