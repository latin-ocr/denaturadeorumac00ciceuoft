DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xiii.

of inverse 10131103 ‘²3 then he says that the celestial
heatb is god—not realizing that the heavens are a
part of that world which elsewhere he himself has
entitled god. But how could the divine consciousness
which he assigns to the heavens persist in a state of
such rapid motion ? Where moreover are all the gods
of accepted belief, if we count the heavens also as a
god Ρ Again, in maintaining that god is incorporeal,
116 robs him entirely of sensation, and also of wisdom.
Moreover, how is motion possible for an incorporea]
being, and how, if he is always in motion, can he
34 enjoy tranquillity and bliss? Nor was his fellow-pupil
Xenocrates any wiser on this subject. His volumes
On the Nature os the Gods give no intelligible account
of the divine form 3 for he states that there are eight
gods z five inhabiting 1116 planets, and in 3 51316 of
motion3 one consisting of 311 1116 fixed stars, which
are 10 be regarded as separate members constituting
3 single deity ; seventh he adds the sun, and eighth
the moon. But what sensation of bliss these beings
can enj oy it is impossible to conceive. Another mem-
ber of the school of Plato, Heraclides of Pontus, filled
volume after volume with childish fictions3 at 0116
moment he deems the world divine, 31 another the
intellect 3 he also assigns divinity to the planets, and
holds that the deity is devoid of sensation and
mutable of form ; and again in the same volume he
35 reckons earth and sky as gods. Theophrastus also is
intolerably inconsistent ; at one moment he assigns
divine pre-eminence to mind, at another to the
heavens, and then again to the constellations and stars

which replicatio here is perhaps a translation, although how
it coglkdebaeetaksgigned to the universe is obscure.
