through them, and on the other hand firm of sub-
stance, to serve as the outer cover of the eye. The
eyes she has made mobile and smoothly turning, so
as both to avoid any threatened injury and to
direct their gaze easily in any direction they desire.
The actual organ of vision, called the pupil or ‘ little
doll,'‘² is so small as easily to avoid obj ects that might
injure it3 and the lids, which are the covers of the
eyes, are very soft to the touch so as not to hurt the
pupil, and very neatly constructed so as to be able
both to shut the eyes in order that nothing may im-
pinge upon them and to open them 3 and nature has
provided that this process can be repeated again and

nished with a palisade of hairs, whereby to ward off
any impinging object while the eyes are open, and
so that while they are closed in sleep, when we do not
need the eyes for seeing, they may be as it were
tucked up for repose. Moreover the eyes are in an
advantageously retired position, and shielded on all
sides by surrounding prominences ; for first the parts
above them are covered by the eyebrows which pre-
vent sweat from flowing down from the scalp and
forehead ; then the cheeks‚ which are placed beneath
them and which slightly project, protect them from
below3 and the nose is so placed as to seem to be

organ of hearing on the other hand is always open,
since we require this sense even when asleep, and
when it receives a sound, we are aroused even from
sleep, The auditory passage is winding, to prevent
anything from being able to enter, as it might if the
passage were clear and straight ; it has further been
