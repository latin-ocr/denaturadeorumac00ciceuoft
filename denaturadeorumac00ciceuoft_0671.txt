truth is discerned. The school of Elis taught a
similar doctrine, but I believe they expounded it iu
30 a more copious and ornate style. If we look down
on these philosophers and think them out of date,
we are undoubtedly bound to feel less contempt for
the following: Aristo, who, having been a disciple
of Zeno, proved in practice what his master estab-
lished in theory, that nothing is good except virtue,
and nothing evil unless it is contrary to virtue;
those motives of action which Zeno held to exist in
things intermediate he deemed to be non-existent.
Aristo’s chief good is in these things to be moved in
neither direction—he himself calls it adiaphoria03
Pyrrho on the other hand held that the wise man
does not even perceive these things with his senses—
the name for this unconsciousness is apatheia. Leav-
ing on one side therefore all these numerous opinions,
let us now look at the following which have long been
31 strongly championed. Others have held that the
end is pleasure 3 their founder was Aristippus, who
had been a pupil of Socrates, and from whom they
get the name of the Cyrenaic school; after him
came Epicurus, whose doctrine is now more famous,
although on the actual subject of pleasure it does not
agree with the Cyrenaics. But Callipho defined the
end as being pleasure and moral goodness, Hier-
onymus as freedom from all annoyance, Diodorus
the same combined with moral goodness—both the
two latter were Peripatetics; but the Old Academy
defined the end as living the moral life while enjoy-
ing those primary things which nature recommends
to man—this is proved by the writings of Polemo,
who is very highly approved by Antiochus ; and also
Aristotle and his adherents seem to come very near
