to perpetuate the species. Tben parts of their bodies
are most skilfully contrived to serve the purposes of
procreation and of conception, and both male and
female possess marvellous desires for copulation.
And when the seed has settled in i'cs place, it draws
almost all the nutriment to itself and hedged within

dropped from 'che womb and has emerged, in
the mammalian species almost all the nourishment
received by the mother turns ’co milk, and 'che young
just born, untaught and by nature’s gmdance, seek
for the teats and satisfy their cravIngs with their
bounty. And to show to us 'chat none of these things
merely happens by chance and that all are the work
of nature's providence and skill, species 'chat produce

bestowed upon them a large number of teats, while
those animals which bear only a few young have only

away, leaving their young to hatch and rear them-
selves. Hens and other birds find a quiet place in
which to lay, and build themselves nests to sit on,
covering these with the softest possible bedding in
order to preserve the eggs most easily3 and when
they have hatched out their chicks they protect them
by cherishing them with their wings so that they
may not be injured by cold, and by shading them
