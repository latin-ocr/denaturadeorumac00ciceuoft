ACADEMICA, II. (LUCULLUS)‚ xli.

For the study and observation of nature affords a
sort of natural pasturage for the spirit and intellect;
we are uplifted, we secm to become more exalted,
we look down on what is human, and while reflecting
upon things above and in the heavens we despise this
world of our own as small and even tiny. There is
delight in the mere investigation of matters at once
of supreme magnitude and also of extreme obscurity ;
while if a notion comes to us that appears to bear
a likeness to the truth‚ the mind is filled with the

128 most humanizing kind of pleasure. These researches
therefore will be pursued both by your wise man and
by this sage of ours, but by yours with the intention of
assenting, believing and affirming, by ours with the
resolve to be afraid of forming rash opinions and to
dcem that it goes well with him if in matters of this
kind he has discovered that which bears a likeness to
truth.

Now let us come to the concept of good and evil: Even you

but a few words must be said first. When they admit

assert those doctrines so positively they seem to me ξξέξααὲῑᾎῃς

to forget that they also lose the guarantee for facts ῗξῖίὲἧξῗὸ]
that appear to be more clear. For their assent to or
acceptance of the fact that daylight is now shining
is no more positive than their assent to the belief
that when a crow croaks it is conveying some com-
mand or prohibition, and if they measure yonder
statue, they will not affirm that it is six feet high
with greater positiveness than they will affirm that
the sun, which they cannot measure, is more than
nineteen times as large as the earth. From this
springs the following train of argument : if it cannot
be perceived how large the sun is, he that accepts all

other things in the same way as he accepts the sun
