DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xxxvi.

and stars that adorn them, and discovering the laws
of the seasons and their periodic successions, con-
jectured that there must exist some supreme and
transcendent being who had created these things,
and who imparted motion to them and guided and
governed them. Though this guess may be wide of
the mark, Ι can see what they are after ; but as for
you, what mighty masterpiece pray do you adduce
as apparently the creation of divine intelligence,
leading you to conjecture that gods exist? ‘ W’e
have an idea of god implanted in our minds,' you say.
Yes, and an idea of Jupiter with 3 beard, and Minerva
in a helmet ; but do you therefore believe that those
1 deities are really like that ? The unlearned multitude
are surely wiser here—they assign to god not only
3 man's limbs, but the use of those limbs. For they
give him bow, arrows, spear, shield, trident, thunder-
bolt3 and if they cannot see what actions the gods
perform, yet they cannot conceive of god as entirely
inactive. Even the Egyptians, whom we laugh at,
deified animals solely on the score of some utility
which they derived from them ; for instance, the ibis,
being a tall bird with stiff legs and a long horny beak,
destroys a great quantity of snakes : it protects
Egypt from plague, by killing and eating the flying
serpents that are brought from the Libyan desert
by the south-west wind, and so preventing them from
harming the natives by their bite while alive and their
stench when dead. I might describe the utility of
the ichneumon, the crocodile and the eat, but I do
not wish to be tedious. I will make my point thus ε
these animals are at all events deified by the bar-
barians for the benefits which they confer, but your
gods not only do no service that you can point to, but
