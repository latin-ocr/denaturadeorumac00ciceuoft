INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

But only matter exists, for only matter can act and
be acted upon ; mind therefore is matter in its
subtlest form, Fire or Breath or Aether. The primal
fiery Spirit creates out of itself the world that we
know, persists in it as its heat or soul or ‘ tension,' is
the cause of all movement and all life, and ultimately
by a universal conflagration will reabsorb the world
into itself. But there will be no pause ε at once the
process will begin again, unity will again pluralize
itself, and all will repeat the same course as before.
Existence goes on for ever in endlessly recurring
cycles, following a fixed law or formula (λόγος) ; this
law is Fate or Providence, ordained by God: the
Stoics even said that the ‘ Logos ' is God. And the
universe is perfectly good ε badness is only apparent,
evil only means the necessary imperfectiori of the
parts viewed separately from the whole.

The Stoic system then was determinist : but in it
nevertheless they found room for freedom of the will.
Man’s acts like all other occurrences are the necessary
effects of causes 3 yet man's will is free, for it rests
with him either willingly to obey necessity, the divine
ordinance, or to submit to it with reluctance. His
happiness lies in using his divine intellect to under·
stand the laws of the world, and in submitting his
will thereto.

Amor-„Mle SCEPTICISM AND Tm: LATER Remum-
The Academic position in Theology was not dogmatic
at all, but purely critical. Within a century of Plato's
death his school had been completely transformed
by Arcesilas, its head in the middle of the third
century 13.c. ; he imported into it the denial of the
possibility of knowledge that had been set up as
a philosophical system by the Sceptic Pyrrho two
