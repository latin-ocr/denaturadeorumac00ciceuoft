it pounces on for itself. It is also recorded of this bird
that it is in the habit of gorging itself with shell-fish,
which it digests by means of the heat of its stomach
and then brings up again, and so picks out from them
125 the parts that are good to eat. Sea-frogs again are
said to be in the habit of covering themselves with
sand and creeping along at the water’s edge, and
then when fishes approach them thinking they are
something to eat, these are killed and devoured by
the frogs. The kite and the erow live in a state of
natural war as it were with one another, and there-
fore each destroys the other’s eggs wherever it finds
them. Another fact (observed by Aristotle, from
whom most of these cases are cited) cannot but
awaken our surprise, namely that cranes when cross-
ing the seas on the way to warmer climates fly in a
triangular formation. With the apex of the triangle
they force aside the air in front of them, and then
gradually on either side α by means of their wings
acting as oars the birds’ onward ssight is sustained,
while the base of the triangle formed by the eranes
gets the assistance of the wind when it is so to speak
astern. The birds rest their necks and heads on the
backs of those flying in front of them ; and the leader,
being himself unable to do this as he has no one to lean
on, flies to the rear that he himself also may have a
rest, while one of those already rested takes his place,
126 and so they keep turns throughout the journey. I
could adduce a number of similar instances, but you
see the general idea. Another even better known class
of stories illustrates the precautions taken by animals
for their security, the watch they keep while feeding,
their skill in hiding in their lairs. L. Other
remarkable facts are that dogs cure themselves by
