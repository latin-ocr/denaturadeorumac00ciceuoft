INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

him engaged upon the whole subject3 he requests
Atticus to send him ‘Brutus’s epitome of the works
of Caelius,’ which he quotes N.D. ii. 8 and several
times in De Divinatione, and ‘ Philoxenus's copy 01
Panaetius's Περὶ Προιόίας,’ which he follows at Div.
ii. 97 and quotes N.D. ii. 118. In a letter to Atticus
a little later (xiii. 8. 1) occur the words ‘ Before

but traces remain suggesting that it was first cast
into three conversations held on three successive days,
each book containing one; see ii. 73, “As you said
yesterday'’ (with note ad loc.)· , iii. 2,‘ ‘I hope you have
before yesterday to prove the existence of the gods.''

CONTENTS or N .D.-De Natura Deorum opens with
a preface dedicating the work to Cicero's friend
Brutus. Cicero explains how philosophy occupies his
retirement from public life and consoles him in the
bereavement of his daughter's death3 and how the
undogmatic style of the Academic school of thought,
of which he was an adherent, was especially suited
to the subject of theology. The scene of the dialogue
