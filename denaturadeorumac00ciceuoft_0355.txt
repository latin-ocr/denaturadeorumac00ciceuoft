DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xv.—xvi.

temperance consists in forgoing bodily pleasures 3
so if there is room for temperance in heaven, there is
also room for pleasure. As for courage, how can god
be conceived as brave ? in enduring pain ? or toil Ρ or

39 danger ? to none of these is god liable. God then is
neither rational nor possessed of any of the virtues :
but such a god is inconceivable ‘² !

‘⁴ In fact, when I reflect upon the utterances of the Popular
Stoica I cannot despise the stupidity of the vulgar Ξοξωῶοὲξέγ
and the ignorant. With the ignorant you get super- irratigtga}
stitions like the Syrians’ worship of a fish,⁶ and the ἓξῗέρᾶῃῗῐῗ

son Palaemon throughout the whole of Greece, as name).
also Hercules, Aesculapius, the sons of Tyndareus;
and with our own people Romulus and many others,
who are believed to have been admitted to celestial
citizenship in recent times, by a sort of extension of

tions of the unlearned ; but what of you philosophers?
how are your dogmas any better? I pass over the
rest of them, for they are remarkable indeed! but
take it as true that the world is itself god—for this, I

suppose, is the meaning of the line

Yon dazzling vault of heaven, which all mankind
As Jove invoke.

Why then are we to add a number of other gods as
well ? And what a crowd of them there is Ξ At least
there seems to me to be a great lot of them ; for you
reckon each of the stars a god, and either call them
by the names of animals such as She-goat, Scorpion,
