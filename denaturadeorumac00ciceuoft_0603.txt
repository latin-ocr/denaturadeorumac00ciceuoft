ACADEMICA, ΙΙ. (Lucumos), xxv.

an eye, since it is a lie of the opinion, not of the eyes.
As though the question were what exists, not what
seems to exist Ξ However, Timagoras may be allowed
to be true to his intellectual ancestry; but as for
you. who say that some sense-presentations are true
and some false, how do you distinguish them apart ?
And do pray desist from mere stock arguments:
those are products we have a home supply of. ¹ If a
god, you say, were to inquire of you whether given
healthy and sound senses, you w ant any thing more,
what would you reply. Ρ Indeed Ι wish he would
make the inquiry! he would be told how badly he
was dealing with us! For even granting that our
sight is accurate, how wide is its range ? Ι can make
out Catulus's place at Cumae from where we are,
and can see it straight in front of me, but I can't
make out his villa at Pompei, although there is
nothing in between to block the view, but my sight
is not able to carry any further. O what a glorious
vlew! We can see Puteoli, but we can’t see our
friend Gaius Avianius, who is very likely taking a
81 stroll in the Colonnade of Neptune‘23 whereas that
somebody or other who is regularly quoted in lectures
used to see an object two hundred and twenty-five
miles offss’ and certain birds can see further. There-
fore Ι should boldly answer that deity of your friends
that I am by no means satisfied with the eyes that I
have got. He will say that my sight is keener than
that of the fishes down there, very likely, which we
cannot see though they are under our eyes at the
very moment, and which also themselves cannot see
us above them ; it follows that we are shut in by an
opaque envelope of air as they are by one of water.
