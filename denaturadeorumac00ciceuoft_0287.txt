manifold and twisted3 it compresses and contains
the dry or moist nutriment that it receives, enabling
it to be assimilated and digested ; at one moment it
is astricted and at another relaxed, thus pressing and
mixing together all that is passed into it, so that by
means of the abundant heat which it possesses, and by
its crushing the food, and also by the operation of the
breath, everything is digested and worked up so as to
be easily distributed throughout the rest of the body.
LV. The lungs on the contrary are soft and of a loose
and spongy consistency, well adapted to absorb the
breath ; which they inhale and exhale by alternately
contracting and expanding, to provide frequent
draughts of that aerial nutriment which is the chief
137 support of animal life. The alimentary juice secreted
from the rest of the food by the stomach flows from
the bowels to the liver through certain ducts or
channels reaching to the liver, to which they are
attached, and connecting up what are called the
doorways of the liver with the middle intestine.
From the liver different channels pass in different
directions, and through these falls the food passed
down from the liver. From this food is secreted bile,
and the liquids excreted by the kidneys 3 the residue
turns into blood and flows to the aforesaid doorways
of the liver, to which all its channels lead. Flowing
through these doorways the food at this very point
pours into the so—called vena cava or hollow vein,⁰ and
through this, being now completely worked up and
digested, flows to the heart, and from the heart is
distributed all over the body through a rather large
number of veins that reach to every part of the frame.

the residue of the food is excreted by the alternate
