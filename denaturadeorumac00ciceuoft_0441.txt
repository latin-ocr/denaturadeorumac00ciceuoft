ACADEMICA ε DEmCATonv LETTER

Cumae, with Pomponius as one of the party 3 Ι have
cast you for the part of champion of Antiochus, whme
doctrine I think I have understood you to approve of,
while I have taken the role of Philo myself. W hen
you read it Ι fancy you will be surprised at our holding
a conversation that never actually took place; but

2 you know the convention as to dialogues. On some
later occasion, my dear Varro, we will if you think fit
have a very full talk together about our personal
affairs as well· , too late, perhaps, but let the destiny
of the commonwealth bear the responsibility for
the days that are past, it is our duty to answer
for the present. And would that we had the
power to carry on these joint studies in a period of
tranquillity, and with the affairs of state settled in
some definite if not satisfactory manner! although in
that case indeed perhaps certain other interests would
afford us honourable subj ects of thought and honour-
able fields of action, · whereas now without our
present studies what reason ha‘ve we to wish to
be alive? For my own part, even m‘th them scarcely
any, but if they be taken from me, not even scarcely!
But we will discuss this when we meet, and re-
peatedly. I hope the move and the salea are turning
out a success: Ι approve of your policy in that
business. Good-bye.
