thing cannot be said to wander if it preserves for all

all the more marvellous in the case of the stars we

another they are uncovered again3 now they ap-

Greek name of which is Phaenon (the shiner), which is
the farthest away from the earth, completos its orbit
in about thirty years, in the course of which period it
passes through a number of remarkable phaseS, at one
time accelerating and at another time retarding its
velocity‚ now disappearing in the evening, then re-
