DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xxxix.—xl.

· for men to take vows upon themselves? Well, but
vows are made by individuals ; therefore the divine
mind gives a hearing even to the concerns of in-
dividuals ; do you see therefore that it is not so
engrossed in business as you thought ? Grant that it
is distracted between moving the heavens and watch-
ing the earth and controlling the seas 2 why does it
suffer so many gods to be idle and keep holiday?
why does it not appoint some of the leisured gods
whose countless numbers you expounded, Balbus, to
superintend human affairs ?

‘¹ This more or less is what I have to say about the
nature of the gods ; it is not my design to disprove it,
but to bring you to understand how obscure it is and
how difficult to explain.''

94 XL. So saying, Cotta ended. But Lucilius said : conclusion.
“ You have indeed made a slashing attack upon the
most reverently and wisely constructed Stoic doc-
trine of the divine providence. But as evening is
now approaching, you will assign us a day on which to
make our answer to your views. For I have to fight
against you on behalf of our altars and hearths, of the
temples and shrines of the gods, and of the city-
walls, which you as pontiffs declare to be sacred and
are more careful to hedge the city round with
religious ceremonies than even with fortifications;
and my conscience forbids me to abandon their cause

, 50 long as I yet can breathe.''

'05 “ I on my side,’' replied Cotta, “ only desire to be
refuted. My purpose was rather to discuss the doc-
trines I have expounded than to pronounce judge-
ment upon them, and I am confident that you can
easily defeat me.''
