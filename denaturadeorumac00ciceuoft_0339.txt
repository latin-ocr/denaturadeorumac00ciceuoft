DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙΙ. viii.—ix.

because the more I do so, the less my mind succeeds
in grasping your meaning. IX. ‘ There is nothing in
the universe superior to the world.' No more is there
anything on earth superior to our city ; but you do
not therefore think that our city possesses a reasoning,
thinking mind ? or, because it does not, you do not
therefore consider, do you, that an ant is to be
rated more highly than this supremely beautiful
city, on the ground that a city does not possess sensa-
tion whereas an ant has not only sensation, but also a
mind that reasons and remembers ? You ought to see
what you can get your opponent to admit, Balbus, not

thought effectively, by the famous old syllogism of
Zeno. Zeno puts the argument thus ι ‘ That which
is rational is superior to that which is not rational;
but nothing is superior to the world ; therefore the
23 world is rational.' If you accept this conclusion, you
will go on to prove that the world is perfectly able to
read a book3 for following in Zeno's footsteps you
will be able to construet a syllogism as follows ε
‘ That which is literate is superior to that which is
illiterate ; but nothing is superior to the world 3
therefore the world is literate.’ By this mode of
reasoning the world will also be an orator, and even
a mathematician, a musician, and in fact an expert in
every branch of learning, in fine a philosopher. You
kept repeating that the world is the sole source of all
created things, and that nature's capacity does not
include the power to create things unlike herself:
am I to admit that the world is not only a living being,
and wise, but also a harper and a flute-player, be-
cause it gives birth also to men skilled in these arts ?
