vomiting and ibises in Egypt by purging—modes of
treatment only recently‚ that is, a few generations
ago, discovered by the talent of the medical profes-
sion. It has been reported that panthers, which in
foreign countries are caught by means of poisoned
meat, have a remedy which they employ to save
themselves from dying 3 and that wild goats in Crete,
when pierced with poisoned arrows, seek a herb
called dittany, and on their swallowing this the
27 arrows, it is said, drop out of their bodies. Does,
shortly before giving birth to their young, thoroughly
purge themselves with a herb called hartwort.
Again we observe how various species defend them-
selves against violence and danger with their own
weapons‚ bulls with their horns, boars with their
tusks, lions with their bite3 some species protect
themselves by flight, some by hiding, the cuttle-fish
by emitting an inky fluid, the sting-ray by causing
cramp‚ and also a number of creatures drive away
their pursuers by their insufferably disgusting odour.

fruits that grow from each plant ; and the same seeds
supply mankind with an abundance of food, besides

of rational design displayed in animals to secure the
perpetual preservation of their kind ? To begin with
some are male and some female, a device of nature
