DRAMATIS PERsoNAE.—Q. Lutatius Catulus, a dis-

Lepidus in ’78 B.c., when he resisted his colleague's
efforts to abrogate the acts of Sulla, and next year
defeated him in the battle of the Milvian Bridge.

on Pompey in 67 and 66, and was censor with Crassus
in 65. He died in 60. There is no evidence that he
was interested in philosophy. In the dialogue he

father, the famous colleague of Marius. The elder
Catulus was a man of great culture and learning,
