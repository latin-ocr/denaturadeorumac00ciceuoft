termed by us ‘ not grasped ' and ‘ not perceived.’
XXX. “ But I drop this point and ask the following
question: if the problems in question are insolublc
and no criterion of them is forthcoming to enable you
to answer whether they are true or false, what be-

which is either true or false ’ ? Taking certain pre-
misses I will draw the conclusion that, of two sets

the following syllogism—‘ If you say that it is light
now and speak the truth‚ it is light 3 but you do say
that it is light now and speak the truth 3 therefore it
is light ’? Your school undoubtedly approve this class
of syllogism and say that it is completely valid, and
accordingly it is the first mode of proof that you give
in your lectures. Either therefore you will approve
of every syllogism in the same mode, or that science
of yours is no good. Consider therefore whether
you will approve the following syllogism : ‘ If you say
that you are lying and speak the truth, you are lying ;
but you do say that you are lying and speak the
truth ; therefore you are lying ' ; how can you not
approve this syllogism when you approved the pre-
vious one of the same class ? These fall-acies are the
inventions of Chrysippus, and even he himself could
not solve them3 for what could he make of this
syllogism—⁶ If it is light, it is light ; but it is light ;
therefore it is light ’? Of course he would agree3
for the very nature of hypothetical infer-enee compels
you to grant the conclusion if you have granted the
premiss. What then is the difference between this
