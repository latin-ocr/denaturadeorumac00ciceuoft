DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙΙ. xi.—xii.

indeed we suppose that the sun holds conversation
with the moon when their courses approximate, or
that the world makes a harmonious music,⁰ as Pyth-
agoras believes. These faculties, Balbus, are the gifts
of nature—not nature ‘ walking in craftsmanlike
manner ’ as Zeno ὸ says (and what this means we
will consider in a moment), but nature by its own
motions and mutations imparting motion and activity

28 to all things. And so I fully agreed with the part of
your discourse ⁰ that dealt with nature's punctual
regularity, and what you termed its concordant
interconnexion and correlation ; but I could not
accept your assertion that this could not have come
about were it not held together by a single divine
breath. On the contrary, the system's coherence and
persistence is due to nature’s forces and not to divine
power ; she does possess that ‘ concord ' (the Greek
term is sympatheia) of which you spoke, but the greater
this is as a spontaneous growth, the less possible is it
to suppose that it was created by divine reason.

avoidable liability to undergo lmpressions from with-
out, that is to suffer and to Ofe;el and if every living
thing is liable to suffering, no living thing' ls not liable
to death. 'lherefore likewise, if every living thing
can be cut up into parts, no living thing ls 1nd1v1slble,
and none is everlasting. But every living thing is so

constructed as to be liable to undergo and to suffer
