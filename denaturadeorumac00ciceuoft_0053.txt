DE NATURA DEORUM, I. ix.

the question, why did these deities suddenly awake
into activity as world-builders after countless ages of
slumber ? for though the world did not exist, it does
not follow that ages did not exist—meaning by ages,
not periods made up of a number of days and nights
in annual courses, for ages in this sense I admit could
not have been produced without the circular motion of

this vast effort of construction took place on account
of a handful of people. For the sake of fools then ?
But in the first place there was no reason for god to
do a service to the wicked ; and secondly, what good
