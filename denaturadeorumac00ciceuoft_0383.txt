DE NATURA DEORUM, III. xxvi.—xxvii.

Yet lthifs verse contains the seeds of every kind of
misc ie .

He with misguided mind
This day hath put the keys into my hand
VVherewith I will unlock my utmost wrath
And work his ruin ς grief shall be my portion
And sorrow his ς mine exile, his extinction.⁰

This gift of reason forsooth, which according to your
school divine beneficence has bestowed on man alone,
67 the beasts do not possess ; do you see then how great
a boon the gods have vouchsafed to us ? And Medea
likewise‚ when flying from her father and her father-
land,
when her sire drew near,
And now was all but in the act to seize her,
‘·'' Her boy she did behead, and joint by joint
Severed his limbs‚ and all about the fields
His body strewed ε the same with this intent,
That, while her father strove to gather up
Her son's dismember’d members, in the meantime
She might herself escape, so that his grief

Should hinder his pursuit, and she win safety
By most unnatural murder of her kinst‘

68 Medea was criminal‚ but also she was perfectly
rational. Again, does not the hero plotting the
direful banquet for his brother turn the design this
way and that in his thoughts ?

More must 1 moil and bigger bale must brew‚
Whereby to quell and crush his cruel heart.⁰

XXVII. Nor must we pass over ssyestes himself, who
Was not content to tempt my wife to sin—-

an offence of which Atreus speaks correctly and ‘vith
perfect truth—
