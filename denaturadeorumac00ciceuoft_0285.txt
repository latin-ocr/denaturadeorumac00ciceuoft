three things requisite for the maintenancc of animal provision
life, food, drink and breath ; and for the reception of Ξῗῖρὲζῇ or
all of these the mouth is most consummately adapted, pisduretpy
receiving as it does an abundant supply of breath 23& ⁸⁰
through the nostrils which communicate with it.
The structure of the teeth within the mouth serves
to chew the food, and it is divided up and sostened by
them.‘² The front teeth are sharp, and bite our viands
into pieces 3 the back teeth‚ called molars, masticate
them, the process of mastication apparently being

15 assisted also by the tongue. Next to the tongue
comes the gullet, which is attached to its roots, and
into which in the first place pass the substances
that have been received in the mouth. The gullet is
adjacent to the tonsils on either side of it, and reaches
as far as the back or innermost part of the palate.
The action and movements of the tongue drive and
thrust the food down into the gullet, which receives
it and drives it further down, the parts of the gullet
below the food that is being swallowed dilating and

36 the parts above it conti-acting. The windpipe, or
trachea ¹² as it is termed by physicians, has an orifice
attached to the roots of the tongue a little above the
point where the tongue is joined to the gullet3 it
reaches to the lungs, and receives the air inhaled by
breathing‚ and also exhales it and passes it out from
the lungs ; it is covered by a sort of lid, provided for
the purpose of preventing a morsel of food from
accidentally falling into it and impeding the breath.
Below the gullet lies the stomach, which is constructed
as the receptacle of food and drink, whereas breath
is inhaled by the lungs and heart. The stomach per-
forms a number of remarkable operations ; its struc-

ture consists principally of muscular fibres, and it is
