of wisd0m‚ the science of living, which is its own
source of consistency. But if this consistency had
nothing that it grasped and knew, whence, I ask, or
how would it be engendered ? consider also the ideal
good man, who has resolved to endure all torments
and to be mangled by intolerable pain rather than
betray either his duty or his promise—why, I ask,
has he saddled himself with such burdensome rules
as this when he had no grasp or perception or know-
ledge or certainty of any fact that furnished 3 reason
why it was his duty to do so? It is therefore ab-
solutely impossible that anybody should set so high
a value upon equity and good saith as to refuse no
torture for the sake of preserving it, unless he has
given his assent to things that cannot possibly be
24 false. As for wisdom herself, if she does not know
whether she is wisdom or not, how in the first place
will she make good her claim to the name of wisdom ?
next, how will she venture with confidence to plan or
execute any undertaking when there will be nothing
certain for her to 361 upon ? indeed, when she m'll
be hesitating in ignorance of what the final and
ultimate good to which all things are to be referred
really is, how can she possibly be wisdom ? This other
point moreover is manifest: there must be a first
principle established for wisdom to follow when she
embarks on any aetion, and this first principle must
be consistent with nature 3 for otherwise appetition
