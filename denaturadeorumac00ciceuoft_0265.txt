DE NATURA DEORUM, ΙΙ. xliv.—xlv.

115 Can any sane person believe that all this array of stars
and this vast celestial adornment could have been
created out of atoms rushing to and fro fortuitously
and at random ? or could any other being devoid of
intelligence and reason have created them ? Not
merely did their creation postulate intelligenee, but
it is impossible to understand their nature without
intelligence of a high order.

XLV. ‘But not only are these things marvellous, The world
but nothing is more remarkable than the stability} mit} them
and coherence of the world, which is such that it is noge eerth

Moreover bodies conj oined maintain their union most
permanently when they have some bond encompass-
ing them to bind them together 3 and this function is
fulfilled by that rational and intelligent substance
which pervades the whole world as the efficient cause
of all things and which draws and collects the outer-

116 most particles towards the centre. Hence if the world
is round and therefore all its parts are held together
by and with each other in universal equilibrium‚ the
same must be the case with the earth, so that all its
parts must converge towards the centre (which in a
sphere is the lowest point) without anything to break
the continuity and so threaten its vast complex of
gravitational forces and masses with dissolution. And
on the same principle the sea, although above the
earth, nevertheless seeks the earth's centre and so is
massed into a sphere uniform on all sides, and never

117 floods its bounds and overflows. Its neighbour the
