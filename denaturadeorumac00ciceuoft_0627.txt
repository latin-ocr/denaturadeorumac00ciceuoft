me back a minaa' (for Diogenes as a Stoic had taught

deal with the withholding of assent, but what Ι am
now going to say has been taken from Volume One.

presentations, which under one are divided into those
that can be perceived and those that cannot, and
under the other into those that are probable and those
that are not probable ⁰; and that accordingly those
presentations that are styled by the Academy con·

to the former division, whereas the latter division
