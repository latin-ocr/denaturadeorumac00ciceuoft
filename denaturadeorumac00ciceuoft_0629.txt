must not be impugned3 and that consequently his
view is that there is no presentation of such a sort as
to result in perception, but many that result in a
judgement of probability. For it is contrary to nature

no sense-presentation has such a character as a false
presentation could not also have without differing
from it at all. Thus the wise man will make use of

counters, if nothing presents itself that is contrary
to that probability, and his whole plan of life will be
charted out in this manner. In fact even the person
whom your school brings on the stage as the wise man
follows many things probable, that he has not grasped
nor perceived nor assented to but that possess veri-
similitude 3 and if he were not to approve them, all
100 life would be done away with. Another point t when
a wise man is going on board a ship surely he has not
got the knowledge already grasped in his mind
and perceived that he will make the voyage as he
intends ? how can he have it ? But if for instance he
were setting out from here to Puteoli, a distance of
four miles, with a reliable crew and a good helinsman
and in the present calm weather, it would appear
probable that he would get there safe. He will there-

plans of action and of inaction, and will be readier at
proving that snow is white than Anaxagoras was (who
not only denied that this was so, but asserted that to
him snow did not even appear white, because he
knew that it was made of water solidified and that
