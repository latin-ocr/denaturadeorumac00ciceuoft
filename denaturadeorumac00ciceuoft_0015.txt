INTRODUCTION TO DE NATURA DEORUM

from many passages in his Letters. And when under
the Triumvirate his career flagged,he turned more and
more to letters. After his return from exile in 57 B.C.
he wrote De Oratore, De Republica, and De Legibus (his
earliest essay in rhetoric, De Inventione, had been
written before he was twenty-five). Rhetoric and
political science again engaged him on his return to
Rome after reconciliation with Caesar in 46 B.c. ; and
early in 45, after the death of his daughter and the
final downfall of Pompey's party at Pharsalus, he
retired to a country-house and gave himself entirely
to study and to writing. He seems to have conceived
the idea of doing a last service to his country by
making the treasures of Greek thought accessible to
Roman readers. His intention is described in the
preface to De Finibus (i. 1-13), in which he commends
the book to his friend Brutus ; no doubt it was pre-
sented to Brutus when he visited Cicero in August
(Ad Att. xiii. 44). Cicero went on with his work
through the following year, after the assassination of
Caesar in March, till in the autumn he flung himself
again into the arena by attacking Antony with the
Philippics 3 and this led on to his proscription and his
death in December 43.

Thus, excepting the treatises named above, the
whole of Cicero's important work in the region of
thought was accomplished in 46—44 13.c., within the
space of two years.

Cicero’s service to philosophy must not be under-
rated. In writing to Atticus (xii. 52) he himself took
a modest view t ‘ You will say ‘⁴ What is your method
in compositions of this kind ? ” They are mere tran-
scripts, and cost comparatively little labour 3 I supply
only the words, of which Ι have a copious flow.’ But
