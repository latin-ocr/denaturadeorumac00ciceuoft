that ‘ hold together ’ the whole of this investigation‚
namely, (1) when certain objects present an appear-
ance of such a kind that other objects also could
present the same appearance without there being
any difference between these presentations, it is im-
possible that the one set of obj ects should be capable
of being perceived and the other set not capable3
but (2), not only in a case in which they are alike in
every particular is there no difference between them,
but also in a case in which they cannot be distin·
guished apart. Having set out these propositione,
they include the whole issue within a single syllo-
gistic argument3 this argument is constructed as
follows ε ‘ Some presentations are true, others false ;
and what is false cannot be perceived. But a true
presentation is invariably of such a sort that a false
presentation also could be of exactly the same sort 3
and among presentations of such a sort that there
is no difference between them, it cannot occur that
some are capable of being perceived and others are
not. Therefore there is no presentation that is
41 capable of being perceived.’ α Now of the proposi-
tions that they take as premisses from which to infer
the desired conclusion, two they assume to be granted,
and indeed nobody disputes them : these are, that
false presentations cannot be perceived, and the
second, that of presentations that have no difference
between them it is impossible that some should be
such as to be capable of being perceived and others
such as to be incapable. But the remaining pre-
misses they defend with a long and varied discourse,
these also being two, one, that of the objects of pre-
sentations some are true, others false, and the other,
that every presentation arising from a true object is
