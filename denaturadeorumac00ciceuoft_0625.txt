sy ⁷llogism and the former one—‘ If you are ly· ing, you
are lying3 but you are lying3 therefore 31011 are
131· ing '? You say that you are unable either to agree
to this or to disprove it; how then are you more able
to deal with the other? if science, reason, method,
in fact if the syllogistic proof is 3311(1, it is the
same in either case. But the farthest length theygo
is to demand that these insoluble problems should be
deemed an exception. My advice to themis to apply
to some tribunea : they will never get that‘ 3331110·
clause' from me. For as they will not get Epicurus,
who despises and laughs at the whole of dialectic, to
admit the validity of 3 proposition of the form‘ Ηο1111-
archus will either be alive to-morrow or not alive,'
whereas dialecticians lay it down that every disjunc-
tive proposition of the form ¹ either a: 01· not-515² is
not only valid but even necessary, 300 how on his
guard the man is whom 310111 friends think 310331; for
‘’If, he says, ‘I admit either of the two to be neccs-
sary, it will follow that Hermarchus must either bc
alive to-morrow or not alive· , but as a matter of fact.
in the nature of things no such necessity exists.’
Thfflefore let the dialecticians, that is, Antiochus and
the Stoics, do battle with this philosopher, for he over—
throws the whole of dialectic, if a disjunctive propo-
sition consisting of two contrary statements—‘ con·
trary ' meaning one of thern affirmative, the other
negative—if a disjunctive proposition of this sort can

»8 be false, none is true 3 but what quai-rel have they with

me, who am a disciple of their own school? When
any situation of this nature occurred, Carneades used
to play with the matter thus. ‘If my conclusion is

threatening if it were not given to annul the whole of the
praetor’ s instruction.
