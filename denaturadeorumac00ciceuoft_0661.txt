ACADEMICA, II. (LUCULLUS)‚ xxxix.

opposite direction to ours, whom you call ‘ anti-
podes 'z why are you more irritated with me who
do not scoff at these doctrines of yours than with
those who when they hear thern think you are out
of your minds? The Syracusan Hicetas, as Theo-
phrastus asserts, holds the view that the heaven, sun,
moon, stars, and in short all of the things on high are
stationary, and that nothing in the world is in motion
except the earth, which by revolving and twisting
round its axis with extreme velocity produces all
the same results as would be produced if the earth
were stationary and the heaven in motion3 and this
is also in some people’s opinion the doctrine stated
by Plato in Timaeus,‘² but a little more obscurely.
What is your view, Epicurus? say, do you really
think that the sun is as small as it appears ? for my
own part I don’t think it is twice as big either! b
Your school are laughed at by Epicurus, and you
yourselves also in your turn mock at him. Mockery
of that sort therefore does not touch Socrates and
does not touch Aristo of Chios, who think that none

sufficiently acquainted with the nature of the sinews
and the veins ? do we grasp what mind is, where it
is, and in fine whether it exists, or, as Dicaearchus
held, does not even exist at all Ρ If it does, do we
know if it has three parts, as Plato ἀ held, reason,
passion and appetite, or is a simple unity ? if simple,
whether it is fire or breath θ or blood,f or, as Xeno-
crates said, an incorporeal numerical formula (a
thing the very nature of which is almost unintelli-
gible)? and whatever it is, whether it is mortal or
everlasting? for many arguments are put forward
