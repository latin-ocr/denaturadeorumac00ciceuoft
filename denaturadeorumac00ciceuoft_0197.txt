But assuming that we have a definite and precor-i
ceived idea of a deity as, first, a living being, and
secondly, a being unsurpassed in excellence by any-
thing else in the whole of nature, I can see nothing
that satisfies this preconception or idea of ours more
fully than, first, the judgement that this world, which
must necessarily be the most excellent of all things,
:6 is itself a living being and a god. Let Epicurus jest
at this notion as he will—and he is a person who jokes
with difficulty, and has but the slightest smack of his
native Attic wit,—let him protest his inability to con-
ceive of god as a round and rotating body. Never-
theless he will never dislodge me from one belief
which even he himself accepts : he holds that gods
exist, on the ground that there must necessarily be
some mode of being of outstanding and supreme
excellence3 now clearly nothing can be more ex-
cellent than the world. N or can it be doubted that a
living being endowed with sensation, reason and in-
telligence must excel a being devoid of those attri-
17 butes; hence it follows that the world is a living
being and possesses sensation, intelligence and
reason3 and this argument leads to the conclusion
that the world is god.
“ But these points will appear more readily a little
later merely from a consideration of the creatures that
the world produces. XVIII. In the meantime, pray,
Velleius, do not parade your school's utter ignorance
of science. You say that you think a cone, a cylinder
