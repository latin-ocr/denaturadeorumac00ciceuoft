DE NATURA DEORUM, II. xxvi—xxvii.

He is said to have married Proserpina (really a Greek
name, for she is the same as the goddess called
Persephone in Greek)—they think that she represents
the seed of corn, and fable that. she was hidden away,
67 and sought for by her mother. The mother is Ceres,
a corruption of ⁴ Geres,‘ from gero, because she bears
the crops; the same accidental change of the first
letter is also seen in her Greek name Βέιηέίέν, a cor-
ruption of ge· meter (⁴ mother earth '). Mavors again
is from magna vertere, ‘the overturner of the great‚’
while Minerva is either ‘ she who minishes ’ or ‘ she
who is minatory.' XXVII. Also, as the beginning
and the end are the most important parts of all
affairs, they held that J anus is the leader in a sacrifice,
the name being derived from ire (⁴ to go ’)‚ hence the
names jani for archways and januae for the front doors
of secular buildings. Again, the name Vesta comes
from the Greeks, for she is the goddess whom they
call Hes-tia. Her power extends over altars and
hearths, and therefore all prayers and all sacrifices
end with this goddess, because she is the guardian of
⁶8 the innermost things. Closely related to this function
are the Penates or household gods, a name derived
either from penus, which means a store of human food
of any kind, or from the fact that they reside penitus,
in the recesses of the house, owing to which they are
also called penetrales by the poets. The name Apoilo
again is Greek; they say that he is the sun,⁰ and
Diana they identify with the moon; the word sol
being from solus, either because the sun ‘ alone ' of all
the heavenly bodies is of that magnitude, or because
when the sun rises all the stars are dimmed and it
⁸ alone ’ is visible; while the name luna is derived
