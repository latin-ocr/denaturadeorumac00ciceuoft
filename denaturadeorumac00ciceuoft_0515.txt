ACADEMICA, II. (LUCULLUS), iv.

him do so before, · but he kept appealing to Hera-
clitus’ s recollection and asking him w hethei he
really thought that those doctrines were Philo’ s, (r
whether he had ever heard them either from Philo
or from any member of the Academy. Heraclitus
always answered No ; but still he recognized it as a
work of Philo’s, and indeed this could not be doubted,
for my learned friends Publius and Gaius Selius and
Tetrilius Rogusb were there to say that they had
heard these doctrines from Philo at Rome and had
copied down the two books in question from Philo’s
12 own manuscript. Then Antiochus put forward the
views that yesterday Catulus told us ⁰ had been put
forward in regard to Philo by his father, and also a
number of others, and did not restrain himself even
from publishing a book against his own teaeherfl
the book to which is givene the title of Sosus.
On this occasion therefore when I heard both Hera-
clitus earnestly arguing against Antiochus and also
Antiochus against the Academics, I gave my atten-
tion more closely to Antiochus, in order to learn
from him his whole case. Accordingly when we had
for quite a number of days had Heraclitus with us
and quite a number of other learned men, among
them Antiochus’s brother Aristus,f and also Aristo
and Dio, to whom he used to assign the greatest
authority next to his brother, we spent a great deal
of time in this single discussion. But we must pass
over the part of it that was directed against Philo,
for he is a less keen opponent who declares that those
doctrines maintained yesterday ⁰, are not the doctrines
of the Academy at all ; for though what he says is

which bore his name: the subject was given to Cicero in the
lost Book ΙΙ. of the second edition (see p. 406).
