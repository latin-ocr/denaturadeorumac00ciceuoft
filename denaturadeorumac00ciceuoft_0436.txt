INTRODUCTION TO ACADEMICA

place on the Gulf of Puteoli (Pozzuoli), just east of
Cumae. In the second edition the scene is laid at
V arro’s villa near the Lucrine Lake, the enclosed
recess of the Gulf of Puteoli. The imaginary date
is near the actual time of composition in 45 B.C.
(⁴ nuper,’ Ac. i. 1).

Souncns OF mmmmm—Cicero frequently states
that his arguments for dogmatism are those of his old
teacher, Antiochus of Ascalon 3 and it is pretty clear
that he merely transcribed them from some book or
books of this authority. For dramatic effect, at
Ac. ii. 11 f. he makes Lucullus profess to be producing
arguments from his recollection of discussions in
which Antiochus had taken part3 but there is no
doubt that actually he is writing with a book of
Antiochus in front of him, probably Sosus (see Ac. ii.
12 note), a dialogue in which Antiochus combated
his old teacher Philo.

The arguments in defence of scepticism come
partly from a work of Philo twice referred to, though
not by its name (Ac. i. 13, ii. ll): this doubtless
supplied Cicero with the historical justification of
the New Academy which concludes Book I., and
probably also with the historical references with
which he begins his speech that ends the work
(Ac, ii. 66-78). The destructive arguments that
these follow are very likely taken from Clitomachus,
who succeeded Carneades as head of the New Academy
in 129 B.c. The constructive doctrines of Carneades
that come next are draxm from two works of Clito-
machus mentioned by their names (ii. 98, 103) ; and
the historical passage that concludes is doubtless also
from Clitomachus, who wrote a book Περὶ Αἶρὲσεων
(Diogenes Laertius ii. 92).
