INTRODUCTION TO ACA DEMICA

Mmuscmprs.—Seholars range the mss. of Academica
Ι. in two families, derived from two archetypes of the
twelfth century or older. Of the former family, one
MS., ‘codex Puteanus,' Parisinus 6331 (which con-
tains De Finibus also), is placed by recent critics in
the twelfth century, and several Mss. related to it
belong to the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Of
the latter family, all are fourteenth or fifteenth
century. In the present edition only a few specially
interesting variants are given, the readings of
Puteanus being quoted as P, but the other Mss.
not being distinguished.

Academica ΙΙ. is contained in the same MSS. as
De Natura Deorum, for which see p. xviii.

ED1T10NS.—J. S. Reid's edition of 1884 (London) is
a most valuable resource ; it contains an exhaustive
introduction and commentary.

The newest text is that of Plasberg (Teubner,
Leipzig, 1922). In this the evidence for the text is
fully set out3 also the preface gives in full all the
passages in Cicero’s Letters that refer to Academica,
and a valuable study of the relation between Cicero's
two editions.

Literary students will also be grateful to Mr. Plasberg
for two quotations that grace the back of his title-page—
one from Pliny (Nat. Hisc. xxxi. 6) which shows that Cicero
actually named his villa at Puteoli (Pozzuoli) ‘ Academia,'
and the other from CopernicuS, writing to Pope Paul ΙΙΙ.
in 1543 and saying that the earliest suggestion which he had

seen that the earth is in motion was a statement that he
quotes from Cicero (viz. Ac. ii. 123).
