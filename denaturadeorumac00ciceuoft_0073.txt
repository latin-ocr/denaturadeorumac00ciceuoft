DE NATURA DEORUM, I. xvi—xvii.

flamed by anger and maddened by lust, and have
displayed to our gaze their wars and battles, their
fights and wounds, their hatreds, enmities and quar-
rels, their births and deaths, their complaints and
lamentations, the utter and unbridled licence of their
passinus, their adulteries and imprisonments, their
unions with human beings and the birth of mortal
3 progeny from an immol-tal parent. With the errors
of the poets may be classed the monstrous doctrines
of the magi and the insane mythology of Egypt, and
also the popular beliefs, which are a mere mass of
inconsistencies sprung from ignorance.

“ Anyone pondering on the baseless and irrational Exposition
character of these doctrines ought to regard Epicurus sssseEolffffiJJean
with reverence, and to rank him as one of the very Univeffsa‘i
gods about whom we are inqui1·ing.‘¹ For he alone per· ξξξὲζὲξπ
ceived,first,that the gods exist,because nature herself proof oflthe
has imprinted a conception of them on the minds of ἓξὲξ, {ffit'
afl mankind. For what nation or what tribe of men pf their .
is there but possesses untaught some ‘ preconception ' fflffgffgity
of the gods? Such notions Epicurus designates by
the word prolepsis, that is, a sort of preconceived
mental picture of a thing, without which nothing
can be understood or investigated or discussed. The
force and value of this argument we learn in that
work of genius, Epicurus's Rule or Stamlard of chdge-

,4 ment]> XVII. You see therefore that the foundation
(for such it is) of our inquiry has becn well and truly
laid. For the belief in the gods has not been estab-
lished by authority, custom or law, but rests on the
unanimous and abiding consensus of mankind ; their
existence is therefore a necessary inference, since we
possess ran instinctive or rather an innate concept of

them3 but a belief which all men by nature share
