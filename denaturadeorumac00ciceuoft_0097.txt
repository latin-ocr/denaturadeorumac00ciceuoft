DE NATURA DEORUM, Ι. xxiv.—xxv.

existence there were no gods; and if the gods had

a beginning, they must also perish, as you were

arguing a little time ago about the world as conceived

by Plato. Where then do we find that happiness and

that eternity which in your system are the two catch-

words that denote divinity ? When you wish to

make this out, you take cover in a thicket of j argon ;

you gave us the formula just now a—-God has not

body but a semblance of body, not blood but a kind

of blood.
9 XXV. “ This is a very common practice with your

school. You advance a paradox, and then, when you

want to escape censure, you adduce in support of it

some absolute impossibility ; so that you would have

done better to abandon the point in dispute rather

than to offer so shameless a defence. For instance, Doctrina 01

Epicurus saw that if the atoms travelled downwards {lsssslfflefve

by their own weight, we should have no freedom of ’

the will, since the motion of the atoms would be deter-

mined by necessity. He therefore invented a device

to escape from determinism (the point had apparently

escaped the notice of Democritus) ε he said that the

atom while travelling vertically downward by the

force of gravity makes a very slight swerve to one
{0 side. This defence discredits him more than if he

had had to abandon his original position. He does and sois

the same in his battle with the logicians. Their ξὲξὲῃωθέ
accepted doctrine is that in every disjunctive pro-
position of the form ‘ so—and-so either is or is not,’ one
of the two alternatives must be true. Epicurus took
alarm ; if such a proposition as ‘ Epicurus either will
or will not be alive to-morrow’ were granted, one or
other alternative would be necessary. Accordingly
he denied the necessity of a disjunctive proposition
