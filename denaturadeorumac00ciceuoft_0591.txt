ACADEMICA, II. (Lamnus), xxii.

reality—for in fact some persons did aver that his
motive was ostentation, and even that he hoped that
his following would be styled the School of Antiochus.
But I am more inclined to think that he was unable
to withstand the united attack of all the philosophers
(for although they have certain things in common on
all other subJects, this is the one doctrine of the
Academics that no one of the other schools approves) ;
and accordingly he gave way, and, just like people
who cannot bear the sun under the New Row,a took
refuge from the heat in the shade of the Old Academy,

71 as they do in the shadow of the Baleonies.b And as
to the argument that he was in the habit of employing
at the period when 110 held that nothing could 110
perceived, which consisted in asking which of his two
doctrines had the famous Dionysius of Heraclea
grasped by means os that unmistakable mark which
according to your school ought to be the foundation
of assent—the doctrine that he had held for many
years and had accepted on the authority of his master
Zeno, that only the morally honourable is good, or
the doctrine that he had made a practice of defending
afterwards, that morality is an empty name, and that
the supreme good is pleasure ?—in spite of Antiochus's
attempt to prove from Dionysius's change of opinion
that no impression can be printed on our minds by a
true presentation of a character that cannot also be
caused by a false one, he yet ensured that the
argument which 110 himself had drawn from Dionysius
should be drawn by everybody else from 1111113011.ο
But with him I will deal more at length else-
where; I turn now, Lucullus, to what was said by
you.
