But my mind agrees in no way with the vision of my
eyes.

53 But you will say that the wise man in an attack of
madness restrains himself from accepting false pre-
sentations as true. So indeed he often does on other
occasions, if his own senses happen to contain an
clement of heaviness or slowness, or if the presenta-
tions are rather obscure, or if he is debarred by lack

instances taken from dreamers, lunatics and drunk-
ards. Do we notice in all this department how in-
consistent that talk is? If we did, we should not
bring forward people who are tipsy or fast asleep or

appear to anybody as they do to a madman or as they
do to a sane person, who can be satisfied of his own
sanity ? to desire to produce this state of affairs is in
