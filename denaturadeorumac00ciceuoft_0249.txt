96 XXXVIII. Thus far Aristotle3 let us for our part
imagine a darkness as dense as that which is said to
have once covered the neighbouring districts on the
occasion of an eruption of the volcano Etna‚ so that
for two days no man could recognize his fellow, and
when on the third day the sun shone upon them. they
felt as if they had come to life again ι well, suppose
that after darkness had prevailed from the beginning
of time, it similarly happened to ourselves suddenly
to behold the light of day, what should we think of the
splendour of the heavens ? But daily recurrence and
habit familiarize our minds with the sight, and we
feel no surprise or curiosity as to the reasons for
things that we see always3 just as if it were the
novelty and not rather the importance of phenomena
that ought to arouse us to inquire into their causes.
97 Who would not deny the name of human being to a
man who, on seeing the regular motions of the heaven
and the fixed order of the stars and the accurate inter-
connexion and interrelation of all things, can deny
that these things possess any rational design, and can
maintain that phenomena, the wisdom of whose
ordering transcends the capacity of our wisdom to
understand it, take place by chance Ρ When we see
something moved by machinery, like an orrery or
clock or many other such things, we do not doubt that
these contrivances are the work of reason3 when
therefore we behold the whole compass of the heaven
moving with revolutions of marvellous velocity and
executing with perfect regularity the annual changes
of the seasons with absolute safety and security for
all things, how can we doubt that all this is effected
