presentations: since just as no animal can refrain
from secking to get a thing that is presented to its
view as suited to its nature (the Greeks term it
οἰΙιείοπ), 50 the mind cannot refrain from giving
approval to a clear object when presented to it.
Nevertheless, assuming the truth of the positions
discussed, all talk whatever about assent is beside
the mark3 for he who perceives anything assents
immediately. But there also follow ‘¹ the points that
without assent memory, and mental concepts of
objects, and sciences‚ are impossible; and most im-
portant os all, granting that some freedom of the will
exists, none m‘ll exist in one who assents to nothing 3
where then is virtue, if nothing rests with ourselvcs?

39 And what is most absurdis that men's vices should be
in their own power and that nobody should sin except
with assent, but that the same should not be true
in the case of virtue, whose sole consistency and
strength is constituted by the things to which it has
given its assent and so to say approval.b And speak-
ing generally, before we act it is essential for us to
experience some presentation, and for our assent
to be given to the presentation3 therefore one who
abolishes either presentation or assent abolishes all
action out of life.
